      "We will think, maybe, even about a possible, if necessary ... reduction in production. Putin, who rules the worlds second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the largest gas exporter, said Russia had a production agreement with other members of the Opec+ oil producers club, so such a drastic step was still only a possibility.",

      "The industry is already underinvested, underfunded, and if we listen only to consumers, then this investment will be reduced to zero, Putin said.",
      "All this will lead at some stage to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of the global energy sector.",

Putin, who rules the worlds second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the largest gas exporter, said Russia had a production agreement with other members of the Opec+ oil producers club, so such a drastic step was still only a possibility.",

      "This will lead to the collapse of the industry itself, because the consumer will always insist that the price be lower.",
      "The industry is already underinvested, underfunded, and if we listen only to consumers, then this investment will be reduced to zero, Putin said.",
      "All this will lead at some stage to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of the global energy sector.",
      "This is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and poorly thought-out. Reuters"

      "President Vladimir Putin says Russia will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the Wests stupid price cap on its oil.",
      "Moscow  Russia, the worlds biggest exporter of energy, could cut oil production and will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the Wests stupid price cap on Russian oil, President Vladimir Putin said on Friday.",
      "The Group of Seven major powers, the EU and Australia last week agreed a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil after EU members overcame resistance from Poland.",
      "As for our reaction, I have already said that we simply will not sell to those countries that make such decisions, Putin told reporters in a news conference in the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek.",
      "We will think, maybe, even about a possible, if necessary ... reduction in production. Putin, who rules the worlds second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the largest gas exporter, said Russia had a production agreement with other members of the Opec+ oil producers club, so such a drastic step was still only a possibility.",
      "We are thinking about this, there are no solutions yet.",
      "And concrete steps will be outlined in a decree from the president of Russia that will be released in the next few days, Putin said.",
      "Selling oil and gas to Europe has been one of the main sources of Russias foreign currency earnings since Soviet geologists found oil and gas in the swamps of Siberia in the decades after World War 2.",
      "Putin dismissed the Wests attempt to squeeze Russian finances, saying the $60 price cap corresponded to the price at which Russia was selling oil.",
      "It all boils down to about this figure, Putin said.",
      "So dont worry about the budget. The price for Urals blend crude on Friday was around $53 per barrel, according to Reuters data.",
      "The Kremlin chief cautioned that attempts by the West to impose a price cap would lead to the global collapse of the oil industry and then a catastrophic rise in prices.",
      "This will lead to the collapse of the industry itself, because the consumer will always insist that the price be lower.",
      "The industry is already underinvested, underfunded, and if we listen only to consumers, then this investment will be reduced to zero, Putin said.",
      "All this will lead at some stage to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of the global energy sector.",
      "This is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and poorly thought-out. Reuters"

      "As the President noted, the price cap for Russian oil introduced by Western countries will eventually affect the entire world market BISHKEK, December 9.",
      "/TASS/.",
      "The efforts to cap oil prices will not harm Russia, President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Friday.",
      "\"The proposed cap corresponds to the prices at which we sell [oil] today.",
      "In this sense, this decision does not affect us in any way.",

      "We also make discounts for many partners.",

      "As the President noted, the price cap for Russian oil introduced by Western countries will eventually affect the entire world market.",
      "\"This applies to all producers.",
      "Why?",
      "Because if someone ever agrees that the consumer will determine the price, then this will lead to the collapse of the industry itself.",
      "Because the consumer will always insist that the price should be lower.",
      "The industry is already underinvested, underfunded.",
      "If we listen only to consumers, then this investment will shrink to zero and at some stage this will lead to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of world energy,\" Putin said.",
      "According to the Russian leader, \"this is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and uncalculated.\"",
      "He called the introduction of a price cap a harmful decision for world energy markets.",
      "At the same time, Putin dismissed the possibility that the price cap would cause problems for the Russian budget.",
      "\"We are selling [oil] at these prices anyway now.",
      "So, dont worry about the budget.",
      "But I repeat once again.",
      "It would be stupid for everyone to follow some non-market, harmful decision.",
      "And for consumers as well because they should realize: if they insist on prices that are comfortable to them, even if they achieve this and prices go down, investments will be reduced to zero, and eventually prices will skyrocket and hit them.",

      "We will think, maybe, even about a possible, if necessary ... reduction in production. Putin, who rules the worlds second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the largest gas exporter, said Russia had a production agreement with other members of the Opec+ oil producers club, so such a drastic step was still only a possibility.",
      "We are thinking about this, there are no solutions yet.",
      "And concrete steps will be outlined in a decree from the president of Russia that will be released in the next few days, Putin said.",

      "It all boils down to about this figure, Putin said.",
      "So dont worry about the budget. The price for Urals blend crude on Friday was around $53 per barrel, according to Reuters data.",
      "The Kremlin chief cautioned that attempts by the West to impose a price cap would lead to the global collapse of the oil industry and then a catastrophic rise in prices.",
      "This will lead to the collapse of the industry itself, because the consumer will always insist that the price be lower.",
      "The industry is already underinvested, underfunded, and if we listen only to consumers, then this investment will be reduced to zero, Putin said.",
      "All this will lead at some stage to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of the global energy sector.",
      "This is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and poorly thought-out. Reuters"

      "There are still enormous unanswered questions that will shape the impact of the measures on the oil market, including the depth of non-European insurance markets, the appetite of some tanker owners to participate in trade with Russia, and exactly how effective enforcement of the cap can be.",
      "The price cap will not have any negative consequences on Russias revenue as the $60 a barrel threshold introduced by western countries corresponds to the prices at which we sell today, Putin said.",

      "President Vladimir Putin says Russia will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the Wests stupid price cap on its oil.",
      "Moscow  Russia, the worlds biggest exporter of energy, could cut oil production and will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the Wests stupid price cap on Russian oil, President Vladimir Putin said on Friday.",
      "The Group of Seven major powers, the EU and Australia last week agreed a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil after EU members overcame resistance from Poland.",
      "As for our reaction, I have already said that we simply will not sell to those countries that make such decisions, Putin told reporters in a news conference in the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek.",
      "We will think, maybe, even about a possible, if necessary ... reduction in production. Putin, who rules the worlds second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the largest gas exporter, said Russia had a production agreement with other members of the Opec+ oil producers club, so such a drastic step was still only a possibility.",
      "We are thinking about this, there are no solutions yet.",
      "And concrete steps will be outlined in a decree from the president of Russia that will be released in the next few days, Putin said.",
      "Selling oil and gas to Europe has been one of the main sources of Russias foreign currency earnings since Soviet geologists found oil and gas in the swamps of Siberia in the decades after World War 2.",
      "Putin dismissed the Wests attempt to squeeze Russian finances, saying the $60 price cap corresponded to the price at which Russia was selling oil.",
      "It all boils down to about this figure, Putin said.",
      "So dont worry about the budget. The price for Urals blend crude on Friday was around $53 per barrel, according to Reuters data.",
      "The Kremlin chief cautioned that attempts by the West to impose a price cap would lead to the global collapse of the oil industry and then a catastrophic rise in prices.",
      "This will lead to the collapse of the industry itself, because the consumer will always insist that the price be lower.",
      "The industry is already underinvested, underfunded, and if we listen only to consumers, then this investment will be reduced to zero, Putin said.",
      "All this will lead at some stage to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of the global energy sector.",
      "This is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and poorly thought-out. Reuters"

      "\"As for our reaction, I have already said that we simply will not sell to those countries that make such decisions,\" Putin told reporters in a news conference in the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek.",
      "\"We will think, maybe, even about a possible, if necessary ... reduction in production.\"",
      "Putin, who rules the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the largest gas exporter, said Russia had a production agreement with other members of the OPEC+ oil producers' club, so such a drastic step was still only a possibility.",
      "\"We are thinking about this, there are no solutions yet.",
      "And concrete steps will be outlined in a decree from the president of Russia that will be released in the next few days,\" Putin said.",
      "Selling oil and gas to Europe has been one of the main sources ofr Russia's foreign currency earnings since Soviet geologists found oil and gas in the swamps of Siberia in the decades after World War Two.",
      "Putin dismissed the West's attempt to squeeze Russian finances, saying the $60 price cap corresponded to the price at which Russia was selling oil.",
      "\"It all boils down to about this figure,\" Putin said.",
      "\"So don't worry about the budget.\"",
      "The price for Urals blend crude on Friday was around $53 per barrel, according to Reuters data.",
      "The Kremlin chief cautioned that attempts by the West to impose a price cap would lead to the global collapse of the oil industry and then a catastrophic rise in prices.",
      "\"This will lead to the collapse of the industry itself, because the consumer will always insist that the price be lower.",
      "The industry is already under-invested, under-funded, and if we listen only to consumers, then this investment will be reduced to zero,\" Putin said.",
      "\"All this will lead at some stage to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of the global energy sector.",
      "This is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and poorly thought-out.\""

      "Russia will not sell oil to any country that imposes a price cap on its oil exports and is considering reducing its oil production, President Vladimir Putin says.",
      "On Monday, the Group of Seven, European Union and Australia imposed a price limit on Russian oil of $60 per barrel in a move aimed at reducing Moscows ability to finance its war in Ukraine.",

      "MOSCOW, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Russia, the world's biggest exporter of energy, could cut oil production and will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the West's \"stupid\" price cap on Russian oil, President Vladimir Putin said on Friday.",
      "The Group of Seven major powers, the European Union and Australia last week agreed to a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil after EU members overcame resistance from Poland.",
      "\"As for our reaction, I have already said that we simply will not sell to those countries that make such decisions,\" Putin told reporters in the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek.",
      "\"We will think, maybe, even about a possible, if necessary ... reduction in production.\"",
      "Putin, who rules the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the largest gas exporter, said Russia had a production agreement with other members of the OPEC+ oil producers' club, so such a drastic step was still only a possibility.",
      "\"We are thinking about this, there are no solutions yet.",
      "And concrete steps will be outlined in a decree from the president of Russia that will be released in the next few days,\" Putin said.",
      "Selling oil and gas to Europe has been one of the main sources of Russia's foreign currency earnings since Soviet geologists found oil and gas in the swamps of Siberia in the decades after World War Two.",
      "White House spokesman John Kirby said Putin's threat was not unexpected but that it remains to be seen what action Moscow ultimately takes, telling reporters in a news briefing: \"We're not surprised by those comments.",
      "It's actually not really new.\"",

      "\"It all boils down to about this figure,\" Putin said.",
      "\"So don't worry about the budget.\"",
      "The price for Urals blend crude on Friday was around $53 per barrel, according to Reuters data.",
      "The Kremlin chief cautioned that attempts by the West to impose a price cap would lead to the global collapse of the oil industry and then a catastrophic rise in prices.",
      "\"This will lead to the collapse of the industry itself, because the consumer will always insist that the price be lower.",
      "The industry is already under-invested, under-funded, and if we listen only to consumers, then this investment will be reduced to zero,\" Putin said.",
      "\"All this will lead at some stage to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of the global energy sector.",
      "This is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and poorly thought-out.\""

      "\"We will think, maybe, even about a possible, if necessary ... reduction in production.\"",
      "Putin, who rules the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the largest gas exporter, said Russia had a production agreement with other members of the OPEC+ oil producers' club, so such a drastic step was still only a possibility.",
      "\"We are thinking about this, there are no solutions yet.",
      "And concrete steps will be outlined in a decree from the president of Russia that will be released in the next few days,\" Putin said.",
      "Selling oil and gas to Europe has been one of the main sources ofr Russia's foreign currency earnings since Soviet geologists found oil and gas in the swamps of Siberia in the decades after World War Two.",
      "Putin dismissed the West's attempt to squeeze Russian finances, saying the $60 price cap corresponded to the price at which Russia was selling oil.",
      "\"It all boils down to about this figure,\" Putin said.",
      "\"So don't worry about the budget.\"",
      "The price for Urals blend crude on Friday was around $53 per barrel, according to Reuters data.",
      "The Kremlin chief cautioned that attempts by the West to impose a price cap would lead to the global collapse of the oil industry and then a catastrophic rise in prices.",
      "\"This will lead to the collapse of the industry itself, because the consumer will always insist that the price be lower.",
      "The industry is already under-invested, under-funded, and if we listen only to consumers, then this investment will be reduced to zero,\" Putin said.",
      "\"All this will lead at some stage to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of the global energy sector.",
      "This is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and poorly thought-out.\""

      "Because the consumer will always insist that the price should be lower.",
      "The industry is already underinvested, underfunded.",
      "If we listen only to consumers, then this investment will shrink to zero and at some stage this will lead to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of world energy,\" Putin said.",
      "According to the Russian leader, \"this is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and uncalculated.\"",
      "He called the introduction of a price cap a harmful decision for world energy markets.",
      "At the same time, Putin dismissed the possibility that the price cap would cause problems for the Russian budget.",
      "\"We are selling [oil] at these prices anyway now.",
      "So, dont worry about the budget.",
      "But I repeat once again.",
      "It would be stupid for everyone to follow some non-market, harmful decision.",
      "And for consumers as well because they should realize: if they insist on prices that are comfortable to them, even if they achieve this and prices go down, investments will be reduced to zero, and eventually prices will skyrocket and hit them.",
      "Hit those who offer such solutions,\" Putin said."

      "Im not saying now that this is a decision, but if necessary well think about possible production cuts, Putin said.",
      "In the news: Florida Surgeon General Finds New Allies To Support His Position On COVID Vaccines Putin stated that Russia would not be financially affected by the $60 cap as the country already sells oil at around such a price and also reiterated that he would not sell oil to countries that impose a price cap, according to Bloomberg.",
      "The average price of Urals crude, the Russian oil benchmark, is currently $53.23 per barrel, according to OilPrice.",

      "He did not elaborate.",
      "The market price of a barrel of Russian Urals crude is currently around $65 dollars, just slightly higher than the $60 cap agreed, suggesting the measure may have only a limited impact in the short term."

      "On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said his nation is eyeing a cut to crude oil production in response to the Group of Seven Nations (G7) price cap on Russian crude, Bloomberg reported Friday.",
      "The G7, which includes the U.S. and Australia, imposed a $60 per barrel price cap on seaborne Russian oil on Dec. 5 to target Moscows oil revenues which are helping fund its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Putin told reporters on Russian state TV that Russia will consider cutting production due to the price cap and added that he would soon announce a presidential decree to further respond to G7s move, according to Bloomberg.",
      "Im not saying now that this is a decision, but if necessary well think about possible production cuts, Putin said.",
      "In the news: Florida Surgeon General Finds New Allies To Support His Position On COVID Vaccines Putin stated that Russia would not be financially affected by the $60 cap as the country already sells oil at around such a price and also reiterated that he would not sell oil to countries that impose a price cap, according to Bloomberg.",
      "The average price of Urals crude, the Russian oil benchmark, is currently $53.23 per barrel, according to OilPrice.",

      "In the news: Florida Surgeon General Finds New Allies To Support His Position On COVID Vaccines Putin stated that Russia would not be financially affected by the $60 cap as the country already sells oil at around such a price and also reiterated that he would not sell oil to countries that impose a price cap, according to Bloomberg.",
      "The average price of Urals crude, the Russian oil benchmark, is currently $53.23 per barrel, according to OilPrice.",

      "The Group of Seven major powers, the European Union and Australia last week agreed a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil after EU members overcame resistance from Poland.",
      "\"As for our reaction, I have already said that we simply will not sell to those countries that make such decisions,\" Putin told reporters in a news conference in the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek.",
      "\"We will think, maybe, even about a possible, if necessary ... reduction in production.\"",
      "Putin, who rules the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the largest gas exporter, said Russia had a production agreement with other members of the OPEC+ oil producers' club, so such a drastic step was still only a possibility.",
      "\"We are thinking about this, there are no solutions yet.",
      "And concrete steps will be outlined in a decree from the president of Russia that will be released in the next few days,\" Putin said.",

      "The Kremlin chief cautioned that attempts by the West to impose a price cap would lead to the global collapse of the oil industry and then a catastrophic rise in prices.",
      "\"This will lead to the collapse of the industry itself, because the consumer will always insist that the price be lower.",
      "The industry is already under-invested, under-funded, and if we listen only to consumers, then this investment will be reduced to zero,\" Putin said.",
      "\"All this will lead at some stage to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of the global energy sector.",
      "This is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and poorly thought-out.\""

      "He added that Moscow will announce retaliatory steps \"in the next few days\".",
      "He did not elaborate.",

      "As the President noted, the price cap for Russian oil introduced by Western countries will eventually affect the entire world market BISHKEK, December 9.",

      "The efforts to cap oil prices will not harm Russia, President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Friday.",
      "\"The proposed cap corresponds to the prices at which we sell [oil] today.",

      "As the President noted, the price cap for Russian oil introduced by Western countries will eventually affect the entire world market.",
      "\"This applies to all producers.",
      "Why?",
      "Because if someone ever agrees that the consumer will determine the price, then this will lead to the collapse of the industry itself.",

      "The industry is already underinvested, underfunded.",
      "If we listen only to consumers, then this investment will shrink to zero and at some stage this will lead to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of world energy,\" Putin said.",
      "According to the Russian leader, \"this is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and uncalculated.\"",
      "He called the introduction of a price cap a harmful decision for world energy markets.",
      "At the same time, Putin dismissed the possibility that the price cap would cause problems for the Russian budget.",
      "\"We are selling [oil] at these prices anyway now.",
      "So, dont worry about the budget.",
      "But I repeat once again.",
      "It would be stupid for everyone to follow some non-market, harmful decision.",

      "Russia will consider slashing its oil output in retaliation to the G7 and European Union's price cap, according to President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\"We will think, maybe even about the possible, if necessary  reduction in production,\" he said at a press event on Friday.",
      "Putin added that Russia's finances wouldn't be hit by the new measures and the West's implementation of a price cap was \"stupid,\" Reuters reported.",
      "He also warned energy prices would \"skyrocket\" for any countries that participated in the price cap.",
      "The defiant remarks come after Russia's central bank warned that the price cap and latest round of sanctions were \"economic shocks\" to the nation.",
      "On Monday, the EU's embargo on seaborne Russian oil imports took effect, along with a $60-a-barrel price cap on Moscow's crude that is meant to prevent a supply shock and limit Putin's energy revenue.",
      "Companies that abide by the price cap will be able to use European shipping and insurance services to send oil to Asia, where some countries have been snapping up Russian oil at hefty discounts since the invasion of Ukraine.",
      "But Russia reducing its oil production could rock energy markets, experts have warned, worsening the supply shortage and hiking crude prices even higher.",
      "That scenario could cause oil prices to surge as high as $380 a barrel, JPMorgan previously predicted, though Russia is also reportedly considering a price floor.",
      "Meanwhile, there have already been shipping disruptions as a result of the EU sanctions.",
      "Oil tankers have piled up off the coast of Turkey as ships were asked for proof of insurance coverage."

      "As the President noted, the price cap for Russian oil introduced by Western countries will eventually affect the entire world market BISHKEK, December 9.",

      "The efforts to cap oil prices will not harm Russia, President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Friday.",

      "As the President noted, the price cap for Russian oil introduced by Western countries will eventually affect the entire world market.",
      "\"This applies to all producers.",
      "Why?",
      "Because if someone ever agrees that the consumer will determine the price, then this will lead to the collapse of the industry itself.",
      "Because the consumer will always insist that the price should be lower.",
      "The industry is already underinvested, underfunded.",
      "If we listen only to consumers, then this investment will shrink to zero and at some stage this will lead to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of world energy,\" Putin said.",
      "According to the Russian leader, \"this is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and uncalculated.\"",
      "He called the introduction of a price cap a harmful decision for world energy markets.",
      "At the same time, Putin dismissed the possibility that the price cap would cause problems for the Russian budget.",
      "\"We are selling [oil] at these prices anyway now.",
      "So, dont worry about the budget.",
      "But I repeat once again.",
      "It would be stupid for everyone to follow some non-market, harmful decision.",
      "And for consumers as well because they should realize: if they insist on prices that are comfortable to them, even if they achieve this and prices go down, investments will be reduced to zero, and eventually prices will skyrocket and hit them.",
      "Hit those who offer such solutions,\" Putin said."

      "MOSCOW, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Russia, the world's biggest exporter of energy, could cut oil production and will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the West's \"stupid\" price cap on Russian oil, President Vladimir Putin said on Friday.",

      "\"We are thinking about this, there are no solutions yet.",
      "And concrete steps will be outlined in a decree from the president of Russia that will be released in the next few days,\" Putin said.",
      "Selling oil and gas to Europe has been one of the main sources of Russia's foreign currency earnings since Soviet geologists found oil and gas in the swamps of Siberia in the decades after World War Two.",
      "White House spokesman John Kirby said Putin's threat was not unexpected but that it remains to be seen what action Moscow ultimately takes, telling reporters in a news briefing: \"We're not surprised by those comments.",
      "It's actually not really new.\"",

      "The price for Urals blend crude on Friday was around $53 per barrel, according to Reuters data.",

      "\"This will lead to the collapse of the industry itself, because the consumer will always insist that the price be lower.",
      "The industry is already under-invested, under-funded, and if we listen only to consumers, then this investment will be reduced to zero,\" Putin said.",
      "\"All this will lead at some stage to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of the global energy sector.",
      "This is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and poorly thought-out.\""

      "MOSCOW: Russia, the world's biggest exporter of energy, may cut oil production and will refuse to sell oil to any country which imposes the West's price cap on Russian oil, President Vladimir Putin said on Friday (Dec 9).",
      "The Group of Seven and Australia last week agreed a US$60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil after European Union members overcame resistance from Poland.",
      "\"As for our reaction, I have already said that we simply will not sell to those countries that make such decisions,\" Putin told reporters in Bishkek.",
      "\"We will think, maybe even about the possible, if necessary ... reduction in production.\"",
      "Putin said that Russia had an agreement with OPEC+ about production so such a drastic step was still only a possibility.",
      "\"We are thinking about this, there are no solutions yet.",
      "And concrete steps will be outlined in the decree of the president of Russia, which will be released in the next few days,\" Putin said.",
      "Putin also said Moscow would not lose out from the West's price cap and that the government's finances would hold up fine.",
      "He said the West's move was \"stupid\" and that energy prices would \"skyrocket\" for those who imposed the caps.",

      "The efforts to cap oil prices will not harm Russia, President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Friday.",

      "As the President noted, the price cap for Russian oil introduced by Western countries will eventually affect the entire world market.",
      "\"This applies to all producers.",

      "The industry is already underinvested, underfunded.",
      "If we listen only to consumers, then this investment will shrink to zero and at some stage this will lead to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of world energy,\" Putin said.",
      "According to the Russian leader, \"this is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and uncalculated.\"",
      "He called the introduction of a price cap a harmful decision for world energy markets.",
      "At the same time, Putin dismissed the possibility that the price cap would cause problems for the Russian budget.",

      "So, dont worry about the budget.",
      "But I repeat once again.",
      "It would be stupid for everyone to follow some non-market, harmful decision.",
      "And for consumers as well because they should realize: if they insist on prices that are comfortable to them, even if they achieve this and prices go down, investments will be reduced to zero, and eventually prices will skyrocket and hit them.",

      "Why?",
      "Because if someone ever agrees that the consumer will determine the price, then this will lead to the collapse of the industry itself.",
      "Because the consumer will always insist that the price should be lower.",
      "The industry is already underinvested, underfunded.",
      "If we listen only to consumers, then this investment will shrink to zero and at some stage this will lead to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of world energy,\" Putin said.",
      "According to the Russian leader, \"this is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and uncalculated.\"",
      "He called the introduction of a price cap a harmful decision for world energy markets.",

      "After months of planning and negotiations, the biggest tranche of international sanctions on Russian oil took effect on Monday.",
      "The European Union banned almost all seaborne imports of the countrys crude oil, and the G-7 agreed that anyone wanting to access key services that the bloc provides  especially insurance  will have to pay less than $60 a barrel.",
      "There are still enormous unanswered questions that will shape the impact of the measures on the oil market, including the depth of non-European insurance markets, the appetite of some tanker owners to participate in trade with Russia, and exactly how effective enforcement of the cap can be.",

      "Output then started to recover, reaching an eight-month high in November.",
      "The price cap wont have any negative consequences on Russias revenue as the $60 a barrel threshold introduced by western countries corresponds to the prices at which we sell today, Putin said.",
      "We already sell at about these prices, so dont worry about the budget. Russias flagship Urals crude thats exported from the Baltic port of Primorsk was assessed at $41.59 a barrel on Thursday, according to data from Argus Media, whose figures the Russian government has used to calculate export duties.",

      "To be honest, it doesnt matter to us.",
      "We also make discounts for many partners.",
      "We all converge approximately at this figure.",
      "Therefore, we will not have losses under any circumstances,\" Putin said.",
      "As the President noted, the price cap for Russian oil introduced by Western countries will eventually affect the entire world market.",
      "\"This applies to all producers.",
      "Why?",
      "Because if someone ever agrees that the consumer will determine the price, then this will lead to the collapse of the industry itself.",
      "Because the consumer will always insist that the price should be lower.",
      "The industry is already underinvested, underfunded.",
      "If we listen only to consumers, then this investment will shrink to zero and at some stage this will lead to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of world energy,\" Putin said.",
      "According to the Russian leader, \"this is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and uncalculated.\"",
      "He called the introduction of a price cap a harmful decision for world energy markets.",
      "At the same time, Putin dismissed the possibility that the price cap would cause problems for the Russian budget.",
      "\"We are selling [oil] at these prices anyway now.",
      "So, dont worry about the budget.",
      "But I repeat once again.",
      "It would be stupid for everyone to follow some non-market, harmful decision.",
      "And for consumers as well because they should realize: if they insist on prices that are comfortable to them, even if they achieve this and prices go down, investments will be reduced to zero, and eventually prices will skyrocket and hit them.",
      "Hit those who offer such solutions,\" Putin said."

      "MOSCOW, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Russia, the world's biggest exporter of energy, could cut oil production and will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the West's \"stupid\" price cap on Russian oil, President Vladimir Putin said on Friday.",
      "The Group of Seven major powers, the European Union and Australia last week agreed to a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil after EU members overcame resistance from Poland.",
      "\"As for our reaction, I have already said that we simply will not sell to those countries that make such decisions,\" Putin told reporters in the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek.",
      "\"We will think, maybe, even about a possible, if necessary ... reduction in production.\"",
      "Putin, who rules the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the largest gas exporter, said Russia had a production agreement with other members of the OPEC+ oil producers' club, so such a drastic step was still only a possibility.",
      "\"We are thinking about this, there are no solutions yet.",
      "And concrete steps will be outlined in a decree from the president of Russia that will be released in the next few days,\" Putin said.",
      "Selling oil and gas to Europe has been one of the main sources of Russia's foreign currency earnings since Soviet geologists found oil and gas in the swamps of Siberia in the decades after World War Two.",
      "White House spokesman John Kirby said Putin's threat was not unexpected but that it remains to be seen what action Moscow ultimately takes, telling reporters in a news briefing: \"We're not surprised by those comments.",
      "It's actually not really new.\"",
      "Putin dismissed the West's attempt to squeeze Russian finances, saying the $60 price cap corresponded to the price at which Russia was selling oil.",
      "\"It all boils down to about this figure,\" Putin said.",
      "\"So don't worry about the budget.\"",
      "The price for Urals blend crude on Friday was around $53 per barrel, according to Reuters data.",
      "The Kremlin chief cautioned that attempts by the West to impose a price cap would lead to the global collapse of the oil industry and then a catastrophic rise in prices.",
      "\"This will lead to the collapse of the industry itself, because the consumer will always insist that the price be lower.",
      "The industry is already under-invested, under-funded, and if we listen only to consumers, then this investment will be reduced to zero,\" Putin said.",
      "\"All this will lead at some stage to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of the global energy sector.",
      "This is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and poorly thought-out.\""

      "MOSCOW, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Russia, the world's biggest exporter of energy, could cut oil production and will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the West's \"stupid\" price cap on Russian oil, President Vladimir Putin said on Friday.",
      "The Group of Seven major powers, the European Union and Australia last week agreed to a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil after EU members overcame resistance from Poland.",
      "\"As for our reaction, I have already said that we simply will not sell to those countries that make such decisions,\" Putin told reporters in the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek.",
      "\"We will think, maybe, even about a possible, if necessary ... reduction in production.\"",
      "Putin, who rules the world's second largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the largest gas exporter, said Russia had a production agreement with other members of the OPEC+ oil producers' club, so such a drastic step was still only a possibility.",
      "\"We are thinking about this, there are no solutions yet.",
      "And concrete steps will be outlined in a decree from the president of Russia that will be released in the next few days,\" Putin said.",
      "Selling oil and gas to Europe has been one of the main sources of Russia's foreign currency earnings since Soviet geologists found oil and gas in the swamps of Siberia in the decades after World War Two.",
      "White House spokesman John Kirby said Putin's threat was not unexpected but that it remains to be seen what action Moscow ultimately takes, telling reporters in a news briefing: \"We're not surprised by those comments.",
      "It's actually not really new.\"",
      "Putin dismissed the West's attempt to squeeze Russian finances, saying the $60 price cap corresponded to the price at which Russia was selling oil.",
      "\"It all boils down to about this figure,\" Putin said.",
      "\"So don't worry about the budget.\"",
      "The price for Urals blend crude on Friday was around $53 per barrel, according to Reuters data.",
      "The Kremlin chief cautioned that attempts by the West to impose a price cap would lead to the global collapse of the oil industry and then a catastrophic rise in prices.",
      "\"This will lead to the collapse of the industry itself, because the consumer will always insist that the price be lower.",
      "The industry is already under-invested, under-funded, and if we listen only to consumers, then this investment will be reduced to zero,\" Putin said.",
      "\"All this will lead at some stage to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of the global energy sector.",
      "This is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and poorly thought-out.\""
