Spain sack Luis Enrique after World Cup flop,"Spain sacked coach Luis Enrique on Thursday after the 2010 champions were dumped out of the World Cup by Morocco at the last-16 stage, quickly naming his replacement as under-21s boss Luis de la Fuente.
Spain started their campaign in Qatar in style by hammering Costa Rica 7-0 and qualified for the knockout phase despite a shock 2-1 defeat to Japan.

They were strong favourites to win their last-16 match against Morocco but crashed out on penalties after the game finished goalless following extra-time.

�Both the president, Luis Rubiales, and the sporting director, Jose Francisco Molina, have told the coach their decision,� the RFEF (football association) said in a statement.

They said they wanted to thank Luis Enrique and his staff for their work, but had decided to start a �new project�.

Shortly afterwards, the federation announced that De la Fuente, who led Spain�s men�s team to the silver medal at last year�s Olympics, was the new man in the hot seat.

Luis Enrique expressed his gratitude to the RFEF for the opportunity he had been given in a farewell message on Instagram.

�What the national team needs is support, in all senses, so that Luis de la Fuente can achieve what he wants,� he wrote, also thanking the players, staff and fans.

�(To) the players, who have been exemplary in their behaviour and faithful to the idea put before them, I am sorry not to have been able to help you more.�

Spain last lifted a major trophy a decade ago at Euro 2012, while they have not won a single knockout game at the Word Cup since triumphing in South Africa in 2010.

� New project �

Luis Enrique took over in 2018 after Spain�s disappointing showing at the World Cup in Russia, and led La Roja to the semi-finals of Euro 2020, where they were also beaten on penalties, by Italy.

His time as Spain coach was characterised by a firm commitment to maintaining possession.

They attempted more than 1,000 passes against Morocco but ended up with nothing to show for it, forcing Yassine Bounou into only one save before the shootout.

The RFEF announced De la Fuente as Luis Enrique�s replacement and his appointment will be ratified next week by the federation�s board of directors.

�The new coach will make his debut in March for Euro 2024 qualifiers, taking charge of his first games against Norway and Scotland,� the RFEF said in a statement.

De la Fuente will be officially presented on Monday as the new coach.

The 61-year-old likes his teams to keep hold of the ball but is more flexible than Luis Enrique and willing to try other strategies when necessary.

By India Today Web Desk: Spain midfielder Gavi has penned an emotional message on social media, thanking former Spain manager Luis Enrique for the faith he showed in him.

Spain replace coach Luis Enrique after early World Cup exit,"Luis de la Fuente to lead national football team after shock defeat to Morocco in the round of 16 of the tournament in Qatar.
Spain�s shock loss to Morocco and elimination from the men�s World Cup has triggered changes for the country�s national football team, with coach Luis Enrique replaced by Luis de la Fuente.

The Spanish football federation on Thursday thanked Enrique but said it was time to �start a new project� following Tuesday�s defeat. The change was made after a recommendation from Spain�s sporting officials.
The 61-year-old de la Fuente, a former left-back with Sevilla and Athletic Bilbao, helped Spain�s under-19 squad win the European Championship in 2015, and the under-21 team win Euro 2019. He also coached Spain�s squad at the Tokyo Olympic Games, where they won a silver medal.

De la Fuente also once coached the senior national team when youth players were used in a friendly against Lithuania because the main squad had to go into isolation because of the coronavirus.

Other candidates who had been considered included former Belgium manager Roberto Mart�nez and ex-Athletic Bilbao coach Marcelino Garc�a Toral.

Spain got off to a good start in Qatar, routing Costa Rica 7-0. But La Roja did not win again in the group stages, drawing 1-1 with Germany and losing 2-1 to Japan before being knocked out in the round of 16 by Morocco on penalties after a goalless draw in normal and extra time.

Enrique, a Barcelona legend, took over the national team in 2018 to start revamping the squad after its elimination in the round of 16 of the World Cup in Russia. He temporarily left because of the illness and eventual death of his young daughter but returned in 2019.

He helped Spain reach the last four of the Nations League twice, including this season and last year when it lost the final to France.

He also led Spain to the semi-finals of the European Championship last year, losing to Italy in a penalty shootout.

The 52-year-old�s contract had been due to end after the World Cup. Moments after the loss to Morocco, he said he would take some time to rest before starting talks with the federation about his future.
The team�s elimination in Qatar raised more questions about whether Spain, the 2010 world champions, should start overhauling their football philosophy and get rid of the �tiki-taka� ball-possession style that has not produced much in the ways of recent results. Enrique had said he was not planning to relinquish the �tiki-taka� if he remained as a coach, and de la Fuente also is likely to keep it alive.

Football analyst Gemma Soler told Al Jazeera that Enrique�s removal did not come as a surprise following the �disaster� in Qatar and described de la Fuente�s appointment as �an internal solution�.

�He�s been the under-21 coach so he knows all this young generation of Spanish new players,� Soler said, adding that the new coach might share his predecessor�s football ideas but in terms of character, the two men are quite different.

�Luis Enrique has such a [strong] personality, he likes to speak and to be in the spotlight, while Luis de la Fuente is the opposite.�

De la Fuente is expected to make his debut with the senior team when Spain resume playing in qualifying for Euro 2024, facing Norway in their opening match of the campaign on March 25 next year.",AI Jazeera,8/12/2022 14:06:58,CENTER,67

DOHA, Qatar (AP) � Luis Enrique was replaced by Luis de la Fuente as Spain's coach on Thursday, two days after the national team was eliminated in the round of 16 at the World Cup.

Spain lost to Morocco 3-0 in a penalty shootout after a scoreless draw in regular and extra time.

The Spanish soccer federation thanked Luis Enrique, but said it was time to �start a new project� to keep the growth achieved by the coach in recent years. It said the change was made after a recommendation by its sporting officials.

Luis Enrique said he was thankful to his players while he was in charge, as well as to federation president Luis Rubiales.

�I'm sorry I wasn't able to help more,� the outgoing coach said in a statement posted on Twitter and Instagram. �It was very special to be part of this.�

He also thanked fans and called for their support to the new coach.

�What the national team needs is support, in all its meaning, so Luis de la Fuente can achieve the goals.�

De la Fuente had coached the senior national team once, when youth players were used in a friendly against Lithuania because the main squad had to go into isolation because of the coronavirus.

Other candidates who had been considered besides De la Fuente, who was Spain's under-21 coach, included former Belgium manager Roberto Mart�nez and former Athletic Bilbao coach Marcelino Garc�a Toral.

Spain got off to a good start in Qatar, routing Costa Rica 7-0, but La Roja couldn't win again in its last three matches. It drew 1-1 with Germany and lost 2-1 to Japan before being held by Morocco.

Luis Enrique took over the national team in 2018 to start revamping the squad after its elimination in the round of 16 of the World Cup in Russia. He temporarily left because of the illness and eventual death of his young daughter, but returned in 2019.

The former Barcelona player and coach had said moments after the loss to Morocco that he would take some time to rest before starting talks with the federation about his future. He said he would have liked to stay with the national team �forever,� but knew that it might not be possible.

The 52-year-old Luis Enrique, not long ago seen as one of the most uptight coaches in soccer, had opened up at the World Cup, doing streaming sessions, going on bicycle rides and talking frankly about controversial issues.

The team�s elimination in Qatar raised more questions about whether Spain should start overhauling its soccer philosophy and get rid of the �tiki-taka� ball-possession style that has not produced results recently. Luis Enrique had said he wasn't planning to relinquish the �tiki-taka� if he remained as coach, and De la Fuente also is likely to keep it alive.

De la Fuente is expected to make his debut with the senior team when Spain resumes playing in qualifying for Euro 2024 in March next year. The federation was also changing its sporting director.

Spain coach Luis Enrique leaves role after shock World Cup exit at hands of Morocco ,"Luis Enrique has left his role as coach of Spain's national team after the country crashed out of the World Cup by losing on penalties to Morocco.

The former Real Madrid and Barcelona player had been in the post since 2018. He will be succeeded by the manager of Spain's under-21 team, Luis de la Fuente.

Spain's shock exit in Qatar followed a goalless draw in the last 16 match which saw Enrique's young side struggle to break down a stubborn Moroccan defence, before a disastrous shootout in which they failed to score, going down 3-0.

Yet the team had begun the tournament in style, crushing Costa Rica 7-0 before drawing with Germany and then losing to Japan, qualifying for the knockout phase on goal difference.

The Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) said in a statement that it ""would like to thank Luis Enrique and all his coaching staff for their work at the head of the senior national team over the last few years"".
""The RFEF sports management has sent the president a report in which it is determined that a new project for the Spanish national football team should be started, with the aim of continuing the growth achieved in recent years thanks to the work carried out by Luis Enrique and his collaborators,"" it added.

Spain sacked coach Luis Enrique on Thursday after the 2010 champions were dumped out of the World Cup by Morocco at the last-16 stage, quickly naming his replacement as under-21s boss Luis de la Fuente.

Spain started their campaign in Qatar in style by hammering Costa Rica 7-0 and qualified for the knockout phase despite a shock 2-1 defeat to Japan.

They were strong favourites for their last-16 match against Morocco but crashed out on penalties after the game finished goalless following extra-time.

""Both the president, Luis Rubiales, and the sporting director, Jose Francisco Molina, have told the coach their decision,"" the RFEF (football association) said in a statement.

They said they wanted to thank Luis Enrique and his staff for their work, but had decided to start a ""new project"".

Shortly afterwards, the federation announced that De la Fuentes, who led Spain's men's team to the silver medal at last year's Olympics, was the new man in the hotseat.

Luis Enrique had said he wanted to stay on as coach after the defeat to Morocco on Tuesday.

""I am very happy with the Spanish FA, the president and with (the sporting director),"" he said.

""If it was up to me I would stay all my life, but that is not the case. I have to think calmly what is the best for me and for the national team.""

Spain last lifted a major trophy a decade ago at Euro 2012, while they have not won a single knockout game at the Word Cup since triumphing in South Africa in 2010.

Luis Enrique took over in 2018 after Spain's disappointing showing at the World Cup in Russia, and led La Roja to the semi-finals of Euro 2020, where they were also beaten on penalties, by Italy.

His time as Spain coach was characterised by a firm commitment to maintaining possession.

They attempted more than 1,000 passes against Morocco but ended up with nothing to show for it, forcing Yassine Bounou into only one save before the shootout.

""We dominated the game but we lacked a goal,"" lamented Luis Enrique. ""We could have been more effective in the final third, but I am more than satisfied with what my players did.

""They represented perfectly what my idea of football is.""

DOHA, Qatar (AP) � Luis Enrique was replaced by Luis de la Fuente as Spain's coach on Thursday, two days after the national team was eliminated in the round of 16 at the World Cup.

Spain lost to Morocco 3-0 in a penalty shootout after a scoreless draw in regular and extra time.

The Spanish soccer federation thanked Luis Enrique, but said it was time to �start a new project� to keep the growth achieved by the coach in recent years. It said the change was made after a recommendation by its sporting officials.

Luis Enrique said he was thankful to his players while he was in charge, as well as to federation president Luis Rubiales.

�I'm sorry I wasn't able to help more,� the outgoing coach said in a statement posted on Twitter and Instagram. �It was very special to be part of this.�

He also thanked fans and called for their support to the new coach.

�What the national team needs is support, in all its meaning, so Luis de la Fuente can achieve the goals.�

The 61-year-old De la Fuente, a former left back with Sevilla and Athletic Bilbao, helped Spain's under-19 squad win the European Championship in 2015, and the under-21 team win Euro 2019. He also coached Spain's squad, which won a silver medal at the Tokyo Olympic Games.

De la Fuente had coached the senior national team once, when youth players were used in a friendly against Lithuania because the main squad had to go into isolation because of the coronavirus.

Other candidates who had been considered besides De la Fuente, who was Spain's under-21 coach, included former Belgium manager Roberto Mart�nez and former Athletic Bilbao coach Marcelino Garc�a Toral.

Spain got off to a good start in Qatar, routing Costa Rica 7-0, but La Roja couldn't win again in its last three matches. It drew 1-1 with Germany and lost 2-1 to Japan before being held by Morocco.

Luis Enrique took over the national team in 2018 to start revamping the squad after its elimination in the round of 16 of the World Cup in Russia. He temporarily left because of the illness and eventual death of his young daughter, but returned in 2019.

He helped Spain reach the last four of the Nations League twice, including this season and last year, when it lost the final to France.

He also led Spain to the semifinals of the European Championship last year, losing to Italy in a penalty shootout.

Luis Enrique�s contract ended after the World Cup. The former Barcelona player and coach had said moments after the loss to Morocco that he would take some time to rest before starting talks with the federation about his future. He said he would have liked to stay with the national team �forever,� but knew that it might not be possible.

The 52-year-old Luis Enrique, not long ago seen as one of the most uptight coaches in soccer, had opened up at the World Cup, doing streaming sessions, going on bicycle rides and talking frankly about controversial issues.

The team�s elimination in Qatar raised more questions about whether Spain should start overhauling its soccer philosophy and get rid of the �tiki-taka� ball-possession style that has not produced results recently. Luis Enrique had said he wasn't planning to relinquish the �tiki-taka� if he remained as coach, and De la Fuente also is likely to keep it alive.

De la Fuente is expected to make his debut with the senior team when Spain resumes playing in qualifying for Euro 2024 in March next year. The federation was also changing its sporting director.",SooToday.com,8/12/2022 06:22:39,LEFT,83

Luis Enrique has left his post as Spain manager after the side�s World Cup last-16 exit to Morocco, with the national team�s under-21 coach, Luis de la Fuente, to replace him.

The Spanish FA (RFEF) issued a statement on Thursday thanking Luis Enrique for his service and expressing its desire to start �a new project� for the national team. A subsequent statement added: �The RFEF has chosen Luis de la Fuente as the new national coach.

�The sporting management of the RFEF has handed to the president a report in which it is determined a new project should start for the Spain national team, with the aim of continuing with the growth achieved in recent years thanks to the work of Luis Enrique and his coaches.

�Both the president, Luis Rubiales, and the sports director, Jose Francisco Molina, have transmitted the decision to [Luis Enrique]. The RFEF energetically wishes Luis Enrique and his team the best of luck in their future professional projects.�

De La Fuente�s appointment is set to be confirmed next Monday, 12 December, in a meeting of the RFEF�s board of directors. The 61-year-old has previously managed Spain�s youth sides at under-19 and under-21 level, winning European titles with both age groups.

Luis Enrique, who guided Barcelona to Champions League glory in 2015, took charge of his country in 2018, shortly after Spain�s exit from that year�s World Cup. He stepped aside for four months in 2019 for personal reasons but returned to oversee a youthful Spanish side�s run to the semi-finals of Euro 2020.

Spain also reached a Nations League final under his guidance but the coach�s future had been the subject of speculation for some time, with reports he was considering a return to club football after the World Cup. Enrique had been unwilling to discuss the situation after Tuesday�s loss, beyond accepting the blame for Spain�s early exit.

The 2010 winners had begun their World Cup campaign in style with a 7-0 thrashing of Costa Rica but were then held to a draw by Germany and beaten by Japan in their final group game. They went out 3-0 on penalties to Morocco after being held to a goalless draw over 120 minutes.

�I'm sorry I wasn't able to help more,� the outgoing coach said in a statement posted on Twitter and Instagram. �It was very special to be part of this.�

He also thanked fans and called for their support to the new coach.

�What the national team needs is support, in all its meaning, so Luis de la Fuente can achieve the goals.�

The 61-year-old De la Fuente, a former left back with Sevilla and Athletic Bilbao, helped Spain's under-19 squad win the European Championship in 2015, and the under-21 team win Euro 2019. He also coached Spain's squad, which won a silver medal at the Tokyo Olympic Games.

De la Fuente had coached the senior national team once, when youth players were used in a friendly against Lithuania because the main squad had to go into isolation because of the coronavirus.

Other candidates who had been considered besides De la Fuente, who was Spain's under-21 coach, included former Belgium manager Roberto Mart�nez and former Athletic Bilbao coach Marcelino Garc�a Toral.

Spain got off to a good start in Qatar, routing Costa Rica 7-0, but La Roja couldn't win again in its last three matches. It drew 1-1 with Germany and lost 2-1 to Japan before being held by Morocco.

Luis Enrique took over the national team in 2018 to start revamping the squad after its elimination in the round of 16 of the World Cup in Russia. He temporarily left because of the illness and eventual death of his young daughter, but returned in 2019.

He helped Spain reach the last four of the Nations League twice, including this season and last year, when it lost the final to France.

He also led Spain to the semifinals of the European Championship last year, losing to Italy in a penalty shootout.

Luis Enrique�s contract ended after the World Cup. The former Barcelona player and coach had said moments after the loss to Morocco that he would take some time to rest before starting talks with the federation about his future. He said he would have liked to stay with the national team �forever,� but knew that it might not be possible.

The 52-year-old Luis Enrique, not long ago seen as one of the most uptight coaches in soccer, had opened up at the World Cup, doing streaming sessions, going on bicycle rides and talking frankly about controversial issues.

The team�s elimination in Qatar raised more questions about whether Spain should start overhauling its soccer philosophy and get rid of the �tiki-taka� ball-possession style that has not produced results recently. Luis Enrique had said he wasn't planning to relinquish the �tiki-taka� if he remained as coach, and De la Fuente also is likely to keep it alive.

""Both the president, Luis Rubiales, and the sporting director, Jose Francisco Molina, have told the coach their decision,"" the Spanish FA said in a statement. The federation said they wanted to thank Luis Enrique and his staff for their work, but had decided to start a ""new project"".

""The sporting direction of the RFEF has given the president a report, in which it was determined that a new project should start for the national team, with the objective of continuing the growth achieved in the last few years thanks to Luis Enrique and his colleagues,"" added the RFEF.

LU ARE A GONER Luis Enrique SACKED as Spain manager after shock World Cup last-16 exit to Morocco with new boss announced moments later,"SPAIN coach Luis Enrique has been sacked after his country�s World Cup flop.

The former Barcelona boss had see-sawed on his position after hinting he planned to quit ahead of the penalty-shoot-out defeat by Morocco and then suggesting he wanted to stay instead.

But just two days after Luis Enrique and his squad landed back in Madrid following their frustrations in the desert, the coach was handed his marching orders by Spanish FA chiefs.

In a statement issued by Madrid bosses, they said: �The sports management of the RFEF (Spanish FA) has transferred to the president a report in which it is determined that a new project should start for the Spanish Soccer Team.

�The aim is continuing with the growth achieved in recent years thanks to the work carried out by Luis Enrique and their collaborators. 

�Both the president, Luis Rubiales, and the sports director, Jose Francisco Molina, have transmitted the decision to the coach.

�The Asturian coach managed to give a new impetus to the national team since his arrival, in 2018, through a profound renovation that has consolidated a generational change in the team and in Spanish football.�

That generational change - with the retirements of the remaining members of the squad that dominated European and world football from 2008 to 2012 - was not enough to save Enrique.

Spain have now gone out of their last three tournaments on penalties, losing to Russia in 2018 and Italy in the Euro 2020 semi-finals with criticism that Enrique�s teams controlled possession but lacked a cutting edge.

His successor has been named as current under-21 coach Luis de la Fuente, who has been in charge of development and youth teams since 2013 and who won both the European under-19 and under-21 titles in that period.",The Sun,8/12/2022 09:49:11,RIGHT,97

On his return, he led the team to the semi-finals of Euro 2020 before a defeat on penalties. They also finished as runners-up in last year�s Nations League finals.

"LUIS ENRIQUE LEAVES SPAIN AS MANAGER AFTER WORLD CUP LAST-16 DEFEAT TO MOROCCO, REPLACED BY LUIS DE LA FUENTE","Spain are on the hunt for a new manager after Luis Enrique left following their disappointing World Cup campaign in Qatar. Enrique�s side lost to Morocco on penalties in a huge upset in the last 16 after failing to break down their opponents over 120 minutes. Enrique took over the national side in 2018, and then again in 2019 after taking a four-month break for �personal issues�.
Luis Enrique has stepped down as Spain manager following their shock early exit at the 2022 World Cup.
Spain crashed out on penalties to Morocco in the last 16 on Tuesday after failing to break down their resilient opponents in a cagy goalless draw.
Enrique claimed his side had practised 1,000 penalties before the tournament, but they failed to convert a single one as they missed out on the quarter-finals in Qatar.
Spain also lost to Japan as they finished second in Group E � and were briefly staring at an even earlier exit when Costa Rica took a shock lead in their final group game before Germany hit back.
The Spanish football federation, the RFEF, said that a ""new project"" would begin soon.
""The RFEF would like to thank Luis Enrique and his entire coaching staff at the helm of the national team in recent years,"" read a statement.
The Spanish produced the biggest statement in the opening round of fixtures with a 7-0 win over Costa Rica, following it up with a 1-1 draw with Germany that put them on course to top the group.
But the surprise 2-1 defeat to Japan pushed them into a knockout tie with Morocco, who had conceded just one goal � a freak own goal � in their opening three fixtures.
Morocco frustrated their more fancied opponents to force a shootout, with Achraf Hakimi clipping a gutsy penalty down the middle to win the match for the north Africans and send Spain home.
Enrique took over as Spain boss in July 2018 after the World Cup in Russia, left the following June amid �personal issues�, then returned in November 2019.
He guided them to the semi-finals at Euro 2020, also losing on penalties to eventual champions Italy.
Spain have replaced Enrique with Spain U21 coach Luis de la Fuente.
In a statement, the RFEF wrote: ""The RFEF has chosen Luis de la Fuente as the new absolute national coach.""
De le Fuente has been part of the national coaching setup for nine years. He first took charge of the U19 side in 2013.

"Luis Enrique sacked by Spain, replaced by De La Fuente","Spain suffered a disappointing last-16 exit at the World Cup after losing to Morocco on penalties on Tuesday.

Luis Enrique is to leave his post as Spain manager and be replaced by Under-21s boss Luis De La Fuente, the country's football federation has announced.

The change comes after Spain's disappointing World Cup last-16 exit on penalties to Morocco on Tuesday.

Enrique's contract had been due to expire at the end of the year and the RFEF issued a statement on Thursday indicating it would not be renewed.

That was then followed by a further statement confirming that De La Fuente had been nominated as his successor and will take up the position from Monday after his appointment is formally ratified.

The first statement read: ""The sporting management of the RFEF has handed to the president a report in which it is determined a new project should start for the Spain national team, with the aim of continuing with the growth achieved in recent years thanks to the work of Luis Enrique and his coaches.

""Both the president, Luis Rubiales, and the sports director, Jose Francisco Molina, have transmitted the decision to the coach.""

Enrique, who guided Barcelona to Champions League glory in 2015, took charge of his country in 2018, shortly after Spain's exit from that year's World Cup.

He stepped aside for four months in 2019 for personal reasons but returned to oversee a youthful Spanish side's run to the semi-finals of Euro 2020.

Spain also reached a Nations League final under his guidance but Enrique's future had been the subject of speculation for some time, with reports he was considering a return to club football after the World Cup.

Enrique was unwilling to discuss the situation after Tuesday's loss in Qatar but the indicators were it seemed a logical juncture for a parting of the ways.

Spain had begun their World Cup campaign in style with a 7-0 thrashing of Costa Rica but were then held to a draw by Germany and were stunned in their last group game by Japan.

They went out 3-0 on penalties to Morocco after being held to a goalless draw over 120 minutes.

The RFEF went on to pay tribute to the good work done by Enrique during his tenure.

Its statement said the 52-year-old had ""given a new impetus to the national team since his arrival"" with his focus on youth bringing about a ""generational change"" and having ""sown hope for the future.""

It concluded: ""The RFEF energetically wishes Luis Enrique and his team the best of luck in their future professional projects.""

In confirming his successor shortly afterwards, a second statement added: ""The RFEF has chosen Luis De La Fuente as the new national coach.""

De La Fuente oversaw Spain's success at the European Under-19 Championship in 2015 and has been Under-21s boss since 2018, winning another Euro crown in 2019.

Luis Enrique took over the national team in 2018 to start revamping the squad after its elimination in the round of 16 of the World Cup in Russia. He temporarily left because of the illness and eventual death of his young daughter, but returned in 2019.

He helped Spain reach the last four of the Nations League twice, including this season and last year, when it lost the final to France.

He also led Spain to the semifinals of the European Championship last year, losing to Italy in a penalty shootout.

Luis Enrique's contract ended after the World Cup. The former Barcelona player and coach had said moments after the loss to Morocco that he would take some time to rest before starting talks with the federation about his future. He said he would have liked to stay with the national team ""forever,"" but knew that it might not be possible.

The 52-year-old Luis Enrique, not long ago seen as one of the most uptight coaches in soccer, had opened up at the World Cup, doing streaming sessions, going on bicycle rides and talking frankly about controversial issues.

The team's elimination in Qatar raised more questions about whether Spain should start overhauling its soccer philosophy and get rid of the ""tiki-taka"" ball-possession style that has not produced results recently. Luis Enrique had said he wasn't planning to relinquish the ""tiki-taka"" if he remained as coach, and De la Fuente also is likely to keep it alive.

De la Fuente is expected to make his debut with the senior team when Spain resumes playing in qualifying for Euro 2024 in March next year. The federation was also changing its sporting director.

Spain boss Luis Enrique sacked following World Cup exit,"Following Spain's humiliating elimination from the 2022 Qatar World Cup at the hands of stubborn Morocco in the round of 16 earlier this week, La Roja's gaffer Luis Enrique was shown the exit on Thursday.

Spain were beaten on penalties by Morocco after a goalless draw on Tuesday in an upsetting result after failing to turn their dominance in the game into a victory.

After the game, the 52-year-old coach admitted that he was to blame for the defeat as his youthful and vibrant team was nothing short of potential and quality.

Former Barcelona boss Luis Enrique was first appointed Spain coach in 2018, bar a four-month period in 2019 when he stepped aside due to the illness and subsequent death of his young daughter. His contract was due to expire at the end of the tournament in Qatar, and it was confirmed on Thursday he will not be staying on.

He led La Roja to the semifinals of the Euro 2020 last year, where they lost on penalties to Italy, and to the 2020-21 Nations League final, where they were beaten by France.

Spain's loss to Morocco was their third straight tournament exit on penalties, having also suffered defeat by that method against hosts Russia in the 2018 World Cup last 16.

Luis Enrique's side started their Qatar 2022 campaign in style with a thumping 7-0 win over Costa Rica, which they followed up with a creditable 1-1 draw against Germany.

However, a 2-1 loss to Japan saw them finish second in Group E and they could not overcome a Morocco side 15 places below them in the latest FIFA rankings.

Spain's failure to score a single penalty in Tuesday's shootout made them just the second team to do so in World Cup history, after Switzerland against Ukraine in 2006.

According to a statement from the Royal Spanish Football Federation, ""Both the president, Luis Rubiales, and the sporting director, Jose Francisco Molina, have informed the coach of their decision.""

""The RFEF would like to thank Luis Enrique and his entire coaching staff at the helm of the absolute national team in recent years,"" the statement read.

""The sports management of the RFEF has transferred to the president a report in which it is determined that a new project should start for the Spanish soccer team.

""The aim is to continue with the growth achieved in recent years thanks to the work carried out by Luis Enrique and their collaborators.""

Luis Enrique leaves post as Spain boss following shock World Cup exit,"Spain announced the departure of Luis Enrique as coach of the national team on Thursday following the team's shock penalty shootout defeat on Tuesday to Morocco in the round of 16 at the World Cup in Qatar, and his replacement was named.

The former Barcelona manager, whose contract with Spain was set to end this month, took full responsibility for his team's earlier than expected exit from the tournament.

The Spanish FA announced that Luis Enrique would be replaced by Spain under-21 manager Luis de la Fuente. De la Fuente, 61, guided Spain's under-19 side to a European Championship title in 2015 and led the under-21s to the same honour in 2019, while he was in charge of the team that won a silver medal at last year's Tokyo Olympics.

A statement from the Spanish FA said: ""The RFEF would like to thank Luis Enrique and his entire coaching staff at the helm of the absolute national team in recent years.

""The RFEF has chosen Luis de la Fuente as the new national coach. The sporting director, Jose Francisco Molina, has transferred a report to the president, Luis Rubiales, in which he recommends the coach to lead the new chapter that begins after the World Cup in Qatar.

""The RFEF board of directors must approve the appointment next Monday.""

De la Fuente will be introduced then, at 12:30 local time.

In a statement published on his social media channels, Luis Enrique thanked the Spanish FA for having appointed him, the players, who he said had been ""exemplary in their behaviour"" and the fans. He also said the national team needed ""support"" to allow De la Fuente to succeed while in charge of Spain.

""Everything started four years ago and how quickly time has passed,"" Luis Enrique said.

""I can only be super grateful to those who appointed me twice (president Rubiales and sporting director Molina).

""How could I not [be grateful] to the players who have been exemplary in their behavior and faithful to the idea put forward. I'm sorry I wasn't able to help you more.

Gracias por todo. pic.twitter.com/VYw094aAQ3

""Last but not least, to the fans who in a uniform way have transmitted their support in all moments and especially the most delicate ones.

""It's time to say goodbye and in these cases just a small reflection... What the national team needs is SUPPORT in all its meaning so that Luis de la Fuente can achieve everything that is proposed.""

Later in the day the Spanish FA announced that sporting director Molina would also leave his role next month after deciding not to renew his contract, with Albert Luque replacing him as director of the national team.

The announcement of Luis Enrique's departure comes as no surprise. Luis Enrique had said in the aftermath of Tuesday's loss to Morocco after a goalless draw that he would discuss his future with Spanish Football Federation president Luis Rubiales next week. However, pressure mounted on Luis Enrique, with fans and national media calling for his resignation after what they described as a ""fiasco.""

Spain players wanted Luis Enrique to continue as coach and had spoken out in his favour.

Luis Enrique, 52, guided Spain to the semifinals of Euro 2020 and the final of the Nations League in 2021, and recently steered La Roja to the final four of the 2023 Nations League.

The Spanish FA had offered him a contract extension before the World Cup but Luis Enrique postponed that decision until after the tournament.

Rubiales praised Luis Enrique's commitment to the national team ahead of the game against Morocco, saying: ""Luis Enrique is a top-level manager, who agreed to take over on a financially weak offer and turned down attractive offers from English clubs. We will speak with him after the World Cup to assess the work that is being done and he will have complete freedom if he wants to leave. I'm really grateful to him. He renewed the blood of the National Team with players under 20 years of age and reunited everyone around the Spain team.""

Spain had the third-youngest squad at the World Cup, with Gavi, 18, and Pedri, who turned 20 during the tournament, as starters while they had Alejandro Balde, 19, and 20-year-old strikers Ansu Fati and Nico Williams coming off the bench.

Spain could not have asked for a better start to the tournament than a 7-0 demolition of Costa Rica, the country's biggest ever World Cup win. Alarm bells began ringing when Germany scored a late equaliser in a 1-1 draw and concerns deepened after Japan came from behind to beat Spain 2-1 in their final Group E game.

The Spanish FA added in their statement: ""The RFEF energetically wishes Luis Enrique and his team the best of luck in their future professional projects. The coach earns the love and admiration of his collaborators in the national team and of the entire federation, which will always be his home.""",ESPN,8/12/2022 06:59:22,LEFT,108

Morocco beat Spain 3-0 in penalty kicks after a 0-0 draw in regulation and extra time in the Round of 16 on Tuesday in Ar Rayyan, Qatar.

""The [Spanish Football Federation] would like to thank Luis Enrique and his entire coaching staff at the helm of the absolute national team in recent years,"" the Spanish Football Federation said.
