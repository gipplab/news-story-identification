BEIJING (AP) � A rash of COVID-19 cases in schools and businesses were reported Friday in areas across China after the ruling Communist Party loosened anti-virus rules as it tries to reverse a deepening economic slump.

While official data showed a fall in new cases, they no longer cover large parts of the population after the government on Wednesday ended mandatory testing for many people. That was part of dramatic changes aimed at gradually emerging from �zero COVID� restrictions that have confined millions of people to their homes and sparked protests and demands for President Xi Jinping to resign.

�There�s very few people coming in because there�s so many cases,� said Gang Xueping, a waitress in a Beijing restaurant. �The country�s just opened up. The first one or two months is definitely going to be serious. Nobody�s used to this yet.�

In other cities, social media users said coworkers or classmates were ill and some businesses had closed due to a lack of staff. It wasn�t clear from those accounts, many of which couldn�t be independently confirmed, how far above the official figure the total case numbers might be.

�I�m really speechless. Half of the company�s people are out sick, but they still won�t let us all stay home,� said a post signed Tunnel Mouth on the popular Sina Weibo platform. The user gave no name and didn�t respond to questions sent through the account, which said the user was in Beijing.

The reports echo the experience of the United States, Europe and other countries that have struggled with outbreaks while trying to restore business activity. But they are a jarring change for China, where �zero COVID,� which aims to isolate every case, disrupted daily life and depressed economic activity but kept infection rates low.

Xi�s government began to loosen controls Nov. 11 after promising to reduce their cost and disruption. Imports tumbled 10.9% from a year ago in November in a sign of weak demand. Auto sales fell 26.5% in October.

�Relaxing COVID controls will lead to greater outbreaks,� Neil Thomas and Laura Gloudeman of Eurasia Group said in a report. �But Beijing is unlikely to return to the extended blanket lockdowns that crashed the economy earlier this year.�

The changes suggest the ruling party is easing off its goal of preventing virus transmission, the basis of �zero COVID,� but officials say that strategy still is in effect.

Restrictions probably must stay in place at least through mid-2023, public health experts and economists say. They say millions of elderly people need to be vaccinated, which will take months, and hospitals need to be strengthened to cope with a surge in cases. Officials announced a vaccination campaign last week.

On Friday, the government reported 16,797 new cases, including 13,160 without symptoms. That was down about one-fifth from the previous day and less than half of last week�s daily peak above 40,000.

More changes announced Wednesday allow people with mild COVID-19 cases to isolate at home instead of going to a quarantine center that some complained were crowded and unsanitary. That addressed a major irritant for the public.

A requirement for subway riders, supermarket shoppers and others to show negative virus tests also was dropped, though they still are needed for schools and hospitals.

A post signed Where Dreams Begin Under Starlight by a user in Dazhou, a southwestern city in Sichuan province, said all but five students in a public school class of 46 were infected.

�It�s really amazing that the school insists students go to school,� the user wrote. The user, contacted through the account, declined to give a name or other details.

The requirement for hundreds of millions of people to be tested as often as once a day in some areas over the past two years helped the government spot infections with no symptoms. Ending that approach reduces the cost of monitoring employees and customers at offices, shops and other businesses. But it increases the risk they might spread the virus.

This week�s changes follow protests that erupted Nov. 25 in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities against the human cost of �zero COVID.�

It isn�t clear whether any of the changes were a response to the protests, which died out following a security crackdown.

The ruling party�s Politburo on Wednesday declared stabilizing weak economic growth its priority, though leaders have said local officials still are expected to protect the public.

�The re-pivot to growth and the exit from zero COVID are clear from the top level,� said Larry Hu and Yuxiao Zhang of Macquarie Group, an Australian bank, in a report. However, they warned, �uncertainties remain high,� including �how disruptive the exit of zero COVID could be.�

Party leaders stopped talking about the official 5.5% annual growth target after the economy shrank by 2.6% from the previous quarter in the three months ending in June. That was after Shanghai and other industrial centers shut down for up to two months to fight outbreaks.

Private sector economists have cut forecasts of annual growth to as low as below 3%, which would be less than half of last year�s 8.1% and among the weakest in decades.

Social media posts suggested some cities might have outbreaks that weren�t reflected in official figures.

Posts dated Thursday by 18 people who said they were in Baoding, a city of 11 million southwest of Beijing, reported they tested positive using home kits or had fevers, sore throats and headaches. Meanwhile, the Baoding city government reported no new cases since Tuesday.

Drugstores were mobbed by customers who bought medications to treat sore throats and headaches after rules were dropped that required pharmacists to report those purchases, prompting fears a customer might be forced into a quarantine center.

Also Friday, the market regulator announced prices of some medicines including Lianhua Qingwen, a traditional flu treatment, rose as much as 500% over the past month. It said sellers might be punished for price gouging.

Lines formed outside hospitals, though it wasn�t clear how many people wanted treatment for COVID-19 symptoms.

People waited four to five hours to get into the fever clinic of Chaoyang Hospital in Beijing, according to a woman who answered the phone there and would give only her surname, Sun. She said no virus test was required but patients had to show a smartphone �health code� app that tracks their vaccine status and whether they have been to areas deemed at high risk of infection.

Hong Kong, which enforces its own anti-virus strategy, has faced a similar rise in cases as the southern Chinese city tries to revive its struggling economy by loosening controls on travel and the opening hours of restaurants and pubs.

Hong Kong reported 75,000 new cases over the past week, up about 25% from the previous week. But those don�t include an unknown number of people who stay at home with COVID-19 symptoms and never report to the government.

Posts dated Thursday by 18 people who said they were in Baoding, a city of 11 million southwest of Beijing, reported they tested positive using home kits or had fevers, sore throats and headaches. Meanwhile, the Baoding city government reported no new cases since Tuesday.

Drugstores were mobbed by customers who bought medications to treat sore throats and headaches after rules were dropped that required pharmacists to report those purchases, prompting fears a customer might be forced into a quarantine center.

Also Friday, the market regulator announced prices of some medicines including Lianhua Qingwen, a traditional flu treatment, rose as much as 500% over the past month. It said sellers might be punished for price gouging.

Lines formed outside hospitals, though it wasn't clear how many people wanted treatment for COVID-19 symptoms.

People waited four to five hours to get into the fever clinic of Chaoyang Hospital in Beijing, according to a woman who answered the phone there and would give only her surname, Sun. She said no virus test was required but patients had to show a smartphone ""health code"" app that tracks their vaccine status and whether they have been to areas deemed at high risk of infection.

Hong Kong, which enforces its own anti-virus strategy, has faced a similar rise in cases as the southern Chinese city tries to revive its struggling economy by loosening controls on travel and the opening hours of restaurants and pubs.

Hong Kong reported 75,000 new cases over the past week, up about 25% from the previous week. But those don't include an unknown number of people who stay at home with COVID-19 symptoms and never report to the government.

China struggles with COVID infections after controls ease,"A rash of COVID-19 cases in schools and businesses were reported Friday in areas across China after the ruling Communist Party loosened anti-virus rules as it tries to reverse a deepening economic slump.

While official data showed a fall in new cases, they no longer cover large parts of the population after the government on Wednesday ended mandatory testing for many people. That was part of dramatic changes aimed at gradually emerging from �zero COVID� restrictions that have confined millions of people to their homes and sparked protests and demands for President Xi Jinping to resign.

�There�s very few people coming in because there�s so many cases,� said Gang Xueping, a waitress in a Beijing restaurant. �The country�s just opened up. The first one or two months is definitely going to be serious. Nobody�s used to this yet.�

In other cities, social media users said coworkers or classmates were ill and some businesses had closed due to a lack of staff. It wasn�t clear from those accounts, many of which couldn�t be independently confirmed, how far above the official figure the total case numbers might be.

�I�m really speechless. Half of the company�s people are out sick, but they still won�t let us all stay home,� said a post signed Tunnel Mouth on the popular Sina Weibo platform. The user gave no name and didn�t respond to questions sent through the account, which said the user was in Beijing.

The reports echo the experience of the United States, Europe and other countries that have struggled with outbreaks while trying to restore business activity. But they are a jarring change for China, where �zero COVID,� which aims to isolate every case, disrupted daily life and depressed economic activity but kept infection rates low.

Xi�s government began to loosen controls Nov. 11 after promising to reduce their cost and disruption. Imports tumbled 10.9% from a year ago in November in a sign of weak demand. Auto sales fell 26.5% in October.

�Relaxing COVID controls will lead to greater outbreaks,� Neil Thomas and Laura Gloudeman of Eurasia Group said in a report. �But Beijing is unlikely to return to the extended blanket lockdowns that crashed the economy earlier this year.�

The changes suggest the ruling party is easing off its goal of preventing virus transmission, the basis of �zero COVID,� but officials say that strategy still is in effect.

Restrictions probably must stay in place at least through mid-2023, public health experts and economists say. They say millions of elderly people need to be vaccinated, which will take months, and hospitals need to be strengthened to cope with a surge in cases. Officials announced a vaccination campaign last week.

On Friday, the government reported 16,797 new cases, including 13,160 without symptoms. That was down about one-fifth from the previous day and less than half of last week�s daily peak above 40,000.

More changes announced Wednesday allow people with mild COVID-19 cases to isolate at home instead of going to a quarantine center that some complained were crowded and unsanitary. That addressed a major irritant for the public.

A requirement for subway riders, supermarket shoppers and others to show negative virus tests also was dropped, though they still are needed for schools and hospitals.

A post signed Where Dreams Begin Under Starlight by a user in Dazhou, a southwestern city in Sichuan province, said all but five students in a public school class of 46 were infected.

�It�s really amazing that the school insists students go to school,� the user wrote. The user, contacted through the account, declined to give a name or other details.

The requirement for hundreds of millions of people to be tested as often as once a day in some areas over the past two years helped the government spot infections with no symptoms. Ending that approach reduces the cost of monitoring employees and customers at offices, shops and other businesses. But it increases the risk they might spread the virus.

This week�s changes follow protests that erupted Nov. 25 in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities against the human cost of �zero COVID.�

It isn�t clear whether any of the changes were a response to the protests, which died out following a security crackdown.

The ruling party�s Politburo on Wednesday declared stabilizing weak economic growth its priority, though leaders have said local officials still are expected to protect the public.

�The re-pivot to growth and the exit from zero COVID are clear from the top level,� said Larry Hu and Yuxiao Zhang of Macquarie Group, an Australian bank, in a report. However, they warned, �uncertainties remain high,� including �how disruptive the exit of zero COVID could be.�

Party leaders stopped talking about the official 5.5% annual growth target after the economy shrank by 2.6% from the previous quarter in the three months ending in June. That was after Shanghai and other industrial centers shut down for up to two months to fight outbreaks.

Private sector economists have cut forecasts of annual growth to as low as below 3%, which would be less than half of last year�s 8.1% and among the weakest in decades.

"China regulators, state banks split staff as fears mount about new COVID outbreaks-sources","HONG KONG/BEIJING, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Chinese regulators and state-owned banks are taking steps to split staff at their workplaces in Beijing, sources told Reuters, as businesses brace for a possible spike in COVID cases after China relaxed virus restrictions in a major policy shift.

The arrangements highlight how lingering anxieties created by Beijing�s three-year �zero-COVID� policy are likely to hamper a quick return to health for the world�s second-largest economy, despite its pivot away from strict containment measures.

China�s top securities regulator has this week moved to a closed-loop system, which refers to a bubble-like arrangement commonly imposed as part of virus prevention measures in China, where employees sleep, live and work isolated from the wider world, said two sources with knowledge of the matter.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) plans to allow only a couple of employees in each department to come to headquarters, and has asked some of them to prepare for a prolonged stay on the premises, the sources said.

Other staff are required to work from home, they added.

Manufacturers and eateries keen to stay open in China are also preferring to err on the side of caution, by retaining COVID-19 curbs until they get a clearer picture of just how workplaces will be affected by the easing of stringent measures.

The China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) this week also issued instructions to its staff based in Beijing and plans to implement split shift working arrangements from next week, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.

The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has informed its staff that it would split them into two groups, with each returning to the workplace on alternate weeks, said another person with direct knowledge of the matter.

The CRSC, CBIRC and NDRC did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.

Chinese government bodies and banks in Beijing have been operating at normal office staffing capacity this year as the city stuck to a stringent zero-COVID protocols, with staff generally not allowed to leave the city for nonessential reasons.

Among China�s big four state-owned banks, Bank of China (BOC) has released a notice to staff that it would split its Beijing workforce into three groups, working in the office on alternate weeks, said a person with direct knowledge.

But the bank has yet to decide when to start such rotations, the person added.

BOC declined to comment.

Other large state banks have also made similar arrangements - splitting up staff into rotating shifts while maintaining a maximum of 10%-20% of staff occupancy in their headquarters in Beijing, said two other people with knowledge of the matter.

�Fear among staff of getting COVID appears to be incredibly high in Beijing at present, as one can assume the virus will move through the city very quickly,� said Tom Simpson, managing director and chief representative of the China-Britain Business Council.

�There is a new fear among people from getting COVID, and that is putting people off from going into the office, and companies are generally not forcing people to go in, either,� he added.

According to a representative from the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, its members are now planning for scenarios where they may be able to continue their general operations in spite of a rise in cases.

�This is not an easy task at the moment, as there is still significant discrepancy between the pandemic-related guidelines of different cities and regions...Given we are now three years into the pandemic, most companies have taken steps to facilitate their staff to work remotely,� said the representative.

A post signed Where Dreams Begin Under Starlight by a user in Dazhou, a southwestern city in Sichuan province, said all but five students in a public school class of 46 were infected.

It's really amazing that the school insists students go to school, the user wrote. The user didn't respond to a question sent through the account.

The requirement for hundreds of millions of people to be tested as often as once a day in some areas over the past two years helped the government spot infections with no symptoms. Ending that approach reduces the cost of monitoring employees and customers at offices, shops and other businesses. But it increases the risk they might spread the virus.

This week's changes follow protests that erupted November 25 in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities against the human cost of zero COVID.

It isn't clear whether any of the changes were a response to protests, which died out following a security crackdown.

The ruling party's Politburo on Wednesday declared stabilizing weak economic growth its priority, though leaders have said local officials still are expected to protect the public.

The re-pivot to growth and the exit from zero-Covid are clear from the top level, said Larry Hu and Yuxiao Zhang of Macquarie Group, an Australian bank, in a report. However, they warned, uncertainties remain high, including how disruptive the exit of zero-Covid could be.

Party leaders stopped talking about the official 5.5 per cent annual growth target after the economy shrank by 2.6 per cent from the previous quarter in the three months ending in June. That was after Shanghai and other industrial centres shut down for up to two months to fight outbreaks.

Private sector economists have cut forecasts of annual growth to as low as below 3 per cent, which would be less than half of last year's 8.1 per cent and among the weakest in decades.

Social media posts suggested some cities might have outbreaks that weren't reflected in official figures.

Posts dated Thursday by 18 people who said they were in Baoding, a city of 11 million southwest of Beijing, reported they tested positive using home kits or had fevers, sore throats and headaches. Meanwhile, the Baoding city government reported no new cases since Tuesday.

Drugstores were mobbed by customers who bought medications to treat sore throats and headaches after rules were dropped that required pharmacists to report those purchases, prompting fears a customer might be forced into a quarantine centre.

Also Friday, the market regulator announced prices of some medicines including Lianhua Qingwen, a traditional flu treatment, rose as much as 500 per cent over the past month. It said sellers might be punished for price-gouging.

Lines formed outside hospitals, though it wasn't clear how many people wanted treatment for COVID-19 symptoms.

People waited four to five hours to get into the fever clinic of Chaoyang Hospital in Beijing, according to a woman who answered the phone there and would give only her surname, Sun. She said no virus test was required but patients had to show a smartphone health code app that tracks their vaccine status and whether they have been to areas deemed at high risk of infection.

Hong Kong, which enforces its own anti-virus strategy, has faced a similar rise in cases as the southern Chinese city tries to revive its struggling economy by loosening controls on travel and the opening hours of restaurants and pubs.

Hong Kong reported 75,000 new cases over the past week, up about 25 per cent from the previous week. But those don't include an unknown number of people who stay at home with COVID-19 symptoms and never report to the government.

COVID-19 cases rise in China as anti-virus controls ease,"Official data showed a fall in new cases, but those no longer cover big parts of the population after the government on Wednesday ended mandatory testing for many people

Beijing: A rash of COVID-19 cases in schools and businesses were reported by social media users Friday in areas across China after the ruling Communist Party loosened anti-virus rules as it tries to reverse a deepening economic slump.

Official data showed a fall in new cases, but those no longer cover big parts of the population after the government on Wednesday ended mandatory testing for many people.

That was part of dramatic changes aimed at gradually emerging from �zero-COVID� restrictions that have confined millions of people to their homes and sparked protests and demands for President Xi Jinping to resign.

Social media users in Beijing and other cities said co-workers or classmates were ill and some businesses closed due to a lack of staff. It wasn�t clear from those accounts, many of which couldn�t be independently confirmed, how far above the official figure the total case numbers might be.

�I�m really speechless. Half of the company�s people are out sick, but they still won�t let us all stay home,� said a post-signed Tunnel Mouth on the popular Sina Weibo platform. The user gave no name and didn�t respond to questions sent through the account, which said the user was in Beijing.

The reports echo the experience of the United States, Europe and other economies that have struggled with outbreaks while trying to restore business activity. But they are a jarring change for China, where �zero COVID,� which aims to isolate every case, disrupted daily life and depressed economic activity but kept infection rates low.

Xi�s government began to loosen controls on 11 November after promising to reduce their cost and disruption. Imports tumbled 10.9 per cent from a year ago in November in a sign of weak demand. Auto sales fell 26.5 per cent in October.

�Relaxing Covid controls will lead to greater outbreaks,� said Neil Thomas and Laura Gloudeman of Eurasia Group in a report, �but Beijing is unlikely to return to the extended blanket lockdowns that crashed the economy earlier this year.�

The changes suggest the ruling party is easing off its goal of preventing virus transmission, the basis of �zero COVID,� but officials say that strategy still is in effect.

Restrictions probably must stay in place at least through mid-2023, public health experts and economists say. They say millions of elderly people need to be vaccinated, which will take months, and hospitals strengthened to cope with a surge in cases. Officials announced a vaccination campaign last week.

On Friday, the government reported 16,797 new cases, including 13,160 without symptoms. That was down about one-fifth from the previous day and less than half of last week�s daily peak above 40,000.

More changes were announced Wednesday to allow people with mild COVID-19 cases to isolate at home instead of going to a quarantine centre that some complained were crowded and unsanitary. That addressed a major irritant for the public.

A requirement for subway riders, supermarket shoppers and others to show negative virus tests also was dropped, though they still are needed for schools and hospitals.

China Struggles With Rise in COVID Cases After Government Eases Anti-Virus Restrictions,"Social media users in Beijing and other cities said coworkers or classmates were ill and some businesses closed due to lack of staff

An elderly man on a stretcher is wheeled into the fever clinic at a hospital in Beijing, Friday, Dec. 9, 2022. China began implementing a more relaxed version of its strict �zero COVID� policy on Thursday amid steps to restore normal life, but also trepidation over a possible broader outbreak once controls are eased.

China struggles with COVID infections after controls ease,"China announces more easing of COVID restrictions following protests

But for some American companies with factories in China, it may be ""too little, too late,"" as some said they are rethinking where they do business in Asia.
BEIJING -- A rash of COVID-19 cases in schools and businesses were reported Friday in areas across China after the ruling Communist Party loosened anti-virus rules as it tries to reverse a deepening economic slump.

While official data showed a fall in new cases, they no longer cover large parts of the population after the government on Wednesday ended mandatory testing for many people. That was part of dramatic changes aimed at gradually emerging from �zero COVID� restrictions that have confined millions of people to their homes and sparked protests and demands for President Xi Jinping to resign.

�There�s very few people coming in because there�s so many cases,� said Gang Xueping, a waitress in a Beijing restaurant. �The country�s just opened up. The first one or two months is definitely going to be serious. Nobody�s used to this yet.�

In other cities, social media users said coworkers or classmates were ill and some businesses had closed due to a lack of staff. It wasn�t clear from those accounts, many of which couldn�t be independently confirmed, how far above the official figure the total case numbers might be.

On Friday, the government reported 16,797 new cases, including 13,160 without symptoms. That was down about one-fifth from the previous day and less than half of last week�s daily peak above 40,000.

More changes announced Wednesday allow people with mild COVID-19 cases to isolate at home instead of going to a quarantine center that some complained were crowded and unsanitary. That addressed a major irritant for the public.

A requirement for subway riders, supermarket shoppers and others to show negative virus tests also was dropped, though they still are needed for schools and hospitals.

A post signed Where Dreams Begin Under Starlight by a user in Dazhou, a southwestern city in Sichuan province, said all but five students in a public school class of 46 were infected.

�It�s really amazing that the school insists students go to school,� the user wrote. The user, contacted through the account, declined to give a name or other details.

The requirement for hundreds of millions of people to be tested as often as once a day in some areas over the past two years helped the government spot infections with no symptoms. Ending that approach reduces the cost of monitoring employees and customers at offices, shops and other businesses. But it increases the risk they might spread the virus.

This week�s changes follow protests that erupted Nov. 25 in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities against the human cost of �zero COVID.�

It isn�t clear whether any of the changes were a response to the protests, which died out following a security crackdown.

The ruling party�s Politburo on Wednesday declared stabilizing weak economic growth its priority, though leaders have said local officials still are expected to protect the public.

�The re-pivot to growth and the exit from zero COVID are clear from the top level,� said Larry Hu and Yuxiao Zhang of Macquarie Group, an Australian bank, in a report. However, they warned, �uncertainties remain high,� including �how disruptive the exit of zero COVID could be.�

Party leaders stopped talking about the official 5.5% annual growth target after the economy shrank by 2.6% from the previous quarter in the three months ending in June. That was after Shanghai and other industrial centers shut down for up to two months to fight outbreaks.

Private sector economists have cut forecasts of annual growth to as low as below 3%, which would be less than half of last year�s 8.1% and among the weakest in decades.

Social media posts suggested some cities might have outbreaks that weren�t reflected in official figures.

Posts dated Thursday by 18 people who said they were in Baoding, a city of 11 million southwest of Beijing, reported they tested positive using home kits or had fevers, sore throats and headaches. Meanwhile, the Baoding city government reported no new cases since Tuesday.

Drugstores were mobbed by customers who bought medications to treat sore throats and headaches after rules were dropped that required pharmacists to report those purchases, prompting fears a customer might be forced into a quarantine center.

Also Friday, the market regulator announced prices of some medicines including Lianhua Qingwen, a traditional flu treatment, rose as much as 500% over the past month. It said sellers might be punished for price gouging.

Lines formed outside hospitals, though it wasn�t clear how many people wanted treatment for COVID-19 symptoms.

People waited four to five hours to get into the fever clinic of Chaoyang Hospital in Beijing, according to a woman who answered the phone there and would give only her surname, Sun. She said no virus test was required but patients had to show a smartphone �health code� app that tracks their vaccine status and whether they have been to areas deemed at high risk of infection.

Hong Kong, which enforces its own anti-virus strategy, has faced a similar rise in cases as the southern Chinese city tries to revive its struggling economy by loosening controls on travel and the opening hours of restaurants and pubs.

Hong Kong reported 75,000 new cases over the past week, up about 25% from the previous week. But those don�t include an unknown number of people who stay at home with COVID-19 symptoms and never report to the government.

China struggles with COVID infections after controls ease,"BEIJING (AP) � A rash of COVID-19 cases in schools and businesses were reported Friday in areas across China after the ruling Communist Party loosened anti-virus rules as it tries to reverse a deepening economic slump.

While official data showed a fall in new cases, they no longer cover large parts of the population after the government on Wednesday ended mandatory testing for many people. That was part of dramatic changes aimed at gradually emerging from �zero COVID� restrictions that have confined millions of people to their homes and sparked protests and demands for President Xi Jinping to resign.

�There�s very few people coming in because there�s so many cases,� said Gang Xueping, a waitress in a Beijing restaurant. �The country�s just opened up. The first one or two months is definitely going to be serious. Nobody�s used to this yet.�

In other cities, social media users said coworkers or classmates were ill and some businesses had closed due to a lack of staff. It wasn�t clear from those accounts, many of which couldn�t be independently confirmed, how far above the official figure the total case numbers might be.

�I�m really speechless. Half of the company�s people are out sick, but they still won�t let us all stay home,� said a post signed Tunnel Mouth on the popular Sina Weibo platform. The user gave no name and didn�t respond to questions sent through the account, which said the user was in Beijing.

The reports echo the experience of the United States, Europe and other countries that have struggled with outbreaks while trying to restore business activity. But they are a jarring change for China, where �zero COVID,� which aims to isolate every case, disrupted daily life and depressed economic activity but kept infection rates low.

Xi�s government began to loosen controls Nov. 11 after promising to reduce their cost and disruption. Imports tumbled 10.9% from a year ago in November in a sign of weak demand. Auto sales fell 26.5% in October.

�Relaxing COVID controls will lead to greater outbreaks,� Neil Thomas and Laura Gloudeman of Eurasia Group said in a report. �But Beijing is unlikely to return to the extended blanket lockdowns that crashed the economy earlier this year.�

The changes suggest the ruling party is easing off its goal of preventing virus transmission, the basis of �zero COVID,� but officials say that strategy still is in effect.

Restrictions probably must stay in place at least through mid-2023, public health experts and economists say. They say millions of elderly people need to be vaccinated, which will take months, and hospitals need to be strengthened to cope with a surge in cases. Officials announced a vaccination campaign last week.

On Friday, the government reported 16,797 new cases, including 13,160 without symptoms. That was down about one-fifth from the previous day and less than half of last week�s daily peak above 40,000.

�Relaxing COVID controls will lead to greater outbreaks,� Neil Thomas and Laura Gloudeman of Eurasia Group said in a report. �But Beijing is unlikely to return to the extended blanket lockdowns that crashed the economy earlier this year.�

The changes suggest the ruling party is easing off its goal of preventing virus transmission, the basis of �zero COVID,� but officials say that strategy still is in effect.

Restrictions probably must stay in place at least through mid-2023, public health experts and economists say. They say millions of elderly people need to be vaccinated, which will take months, and hospitals need to be strengthened to cope with a surge in cases. Officials announced a vaccination campaign last week.

On Friday, the government reported 16,797 new cases, including 13,160 without symptoms. That was down about one-fifth from the previous day and less than half of last week�s daily peak above 40,000.

More changes announced Wednesday allow people with mild COVID-19 cases to isolate at home instead of going to a quarantine center that some complained were crowded and unsanitary. That addressed a major irritant for the public.

A requirement for subway riders, supermarket shoppers and others to show negative virus tests also was dropped, though they still are needed for schools and hospitals.

A post signed Where Dreams Begin Under Starlight by a user in Dazhou, a southwestern city in Sichuan province, said all but five students in a public school class of 46 were infected.

�It�s really amazing that the school insists students go to school,� the user wrote. The user, contacted through the account, declined to give a name or other details.

The requirement for hundreds of millions of people to be tested as often as once a day in some areas over the past two years helped the government spot infections with no symptoms. Ending that approach reduces the cost of monitoring employees and customers at offices, shops and other businesses. But it increases the risk they might spread the virus.

This week�s changes follow protests that erupted Nov. 25 in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities against the human cost of �zero COVID.�

It isn�t clear whether any of the changes were a response to the protests, which died out following a security crackdown.

The ruling party�s Politburo on Wednesday declared stabilizing weak economic growth its priority, though leaders have said local officials still are expected to protect the public.

�The re-pivot to growth and the exit from zero COVID are clear from the top level,� said Larry Hu and Yuxiao Zhang of Macquarie Group, an Australian bank, in a report. However, they warned, �uncertainties remain high,� including �how disruptive the exit of zero COVID could be.�

Party leaders stopped talking about the official 5.5% annual growth target after the economy shrank by 2.6% from the previous quarter in the three months ending in June. That was after Shanghai and other industrial centers shut down for up to two months to fight outbreaks.

Private sector economists have cut forecasts of annual growth to as low as below 3%, which would be less than half of last year�s 8.1% and among the weakest in decades.

Social media posts suggested some cities might have outbreaks that weren�t reflected in official figures.

Posts dated Thursday by 18 people who said they were in Baoding, a city of 11 million southwest of Beijing, reported they tested positive using home kits or had fevers, sore throats and headaches. Meanwhile, the Baoding city government reported no new cases since Tuesday.

Drugstores were mobbed by customers who bought medications to treat sore throats and headaches after rules were dropped that required pharmacists to report those purchases, prompting fears a customer might be forced into a quarantine center.

Also Friday, the market regulator announced prices of some medicines including Lianhua Qingwen, a traditional flu treatment, rose as much as 500% over the past month. It said sellers might be punished for price gouging.

Lines formed outside hospitals, though it wasn�t clear how many people wanted treatment for COVID-19 symptoms.

People waited four to five hours to get into the fever clinic of Chaoyang Hospital in Beijing, according to a woman who answered the phone there and would give only her surname, Sun. She said no virus test was required but patients had to show a smartphone �health code� app that tracks their vaccine status and whether they have been to areas deemed at high risk of infection.

Hong Kong, which enforces its own anti-virus strategy, has faced a similar rise in cases as the southern Chinese city tries to revive its struggling economy by loosening controls on travel and the opening hours of restaurants and pubs.

Hong Kong reported 75,000 new cases over the past week, up about 25% from the previous week. But those don�t include an unknown number of people who stay at home with COVID-19 symptoms and never report to the government.

China struggles with COVID infections after controls ease,"BEIJING (AP) � A rash of COVID-19 cases in schools and businesses were reported Friday in areas across China after the ruling Communist Party loosened anti-virus rules as it tries to reverse a deepening economic slump.

While official data showed a fall in new cases, they no longer cover large parts of the population after the government on Wednesday ended mandatory testing for many people. That was part of dramatic changes aimed at gradually emerging from �zero COVID� restrictions that have confined millions of people to their homes and sparked protests and demands for President Xi Jinping to resign.

�There�s very few people coming in because there�s so many cases,� said Gang Xueping, a waitress in a Beijing restaurant. �The country�s just opened up. The first one or two months is definitely going to be serious. Nobody�s used to this yet.�

In other cities, social media users said coworkers or classmates were ill and some businesses had closed due to a lack of staff. It wasn�t clear from those accounts, many of which couldn�t be independently confirmed, how far above the official figure the total case numbers might be.

�I�m really speechless. Half of the company�s people are out sick, but they still won�t let us all stay home,� said a post signed Tunnel Mouth on the popular Sina Weibo platform. The user gave no name and didn�t respond to questions sent through the account, which said the user was in Beijing.

End of 'zero-COVID' threatens to overwhelm China with infections,"China faces a daunting task after abruptly giving up on ""zero-COVID,"" with infections set to surge and deaths predicted to top 2 million.

The world�s most populous nation is rapidly abandoning the mass testing, lockdowns and centralized quarantine that defined the three-year old policy. Little time has been spent putting in place mitigation measures to deal with the resulting increase in cases, which could total 5.6 million a day at the peak, according to some estimates.

Unlike the whack-a-mole pattern of outbreaks that took place in the U.S. and Europe over months and years, China is likely to see a wave of infections engulf the country all at once in a population that until now has largely avoided exposure to the virus.

The result is China�s acceptance of COVID-19 will be like nothing the world has seen in the pandemic. Experts in science to economics paint a picture of impending chaos, with absenteeism paralyzing factories, serious disease overwhelming hospitals and outbreaks forcing residents to hunker down in their homes. Between 1.3 million and 2.1 million people may die, based on Hong Kong�s earlier experience with omicron, according to an estimate by London-based research firm Airfinity.

""It will be all over the country almost at the same time, but first in urban areas and then in rural because of the crowding,� said Ali Mokdad, a professor at the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation and chief strategy officer for population health at the University of Washington. ""It will be one month from now when we see very high numbers of cases, and mortality will come two weeks later. It will never come back down to where it is now.�

That projection would put the peak close to the start of Lunar New Year, the most important holiday of the year in China. Before COVID-19, the weeklong holiday was the biggest mass migration event in the world as city workers returned to their home villages for an annual visit. Winter weather will increase the spread of the virus as people spend more time inside.

The challenges will be formidable. Nursing homes will have to battle to protect their vulnerable, schools will close for extended periods as waves of infection hit and businesses won�t have enough workers as illness takes hold. China�s reliance on less potent homegrown vaccines means multiple shots are essential, while a dearth of circulating virus allowed people � most worrisomely the elderly � to skip immunization until now.

China won�t be the first to transition from zero-COVID, a process navigated with varying degrees of success by Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia. And while pangs of fear were common worldwide as the virus first took hold in communities, the places that fought it most ferociously face an additional hurdle because living with the virus requires a mental shift that can be hard to accept.

""I don�t think anything looks good for China right now,� said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ""Its 1.4 billion people are at increased risk of contracting this virus for the first time, and these first infections surely pose the risk of serious disease, including hospitalizations and deaths.�

Investors have been more sanguine. Initial indications that China was exiting zero-COVID buoyed the nation�s financial markets on expectations that the release of pent-up demand would spur consumer spending and drive an economic recovery.

The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of stocks surged 29% in Hong Kong in November, its best month since 2003. The gains came off a low base � the gauge ended October at the lowest level at an almost 17-year low. The yuan wiped out nearly a third of its yearly loss last month before surging past the key 7 per dollar level on Monday.

More volatility is expected as the impact of rising infections becomes clear.

""Though the market is still trading on the positive expectations, we are not entirely out of the woods, as we still have to get past the panic that might come with the first wave of infections,� said Ma Xuzhen, fund manager at Longquan Fund in Hangzhou.

Nevertheless, China has some advantages as it tries to fend off the worst-case scenario.

From its position in the back of the pack, China can use information gleaned from the experiences of other parts of the world, including Hong Kong which struggled with its own deadly wave earlier in the year.

The country also faces a strain in omicron that�s milder than previous forms.

""At this stage, the virus is totally different; being infected isn�t that serious,� said Xiaolin Wei, chair of global health policy at the University of Toronto�s School of Public Health. ""Right now, the death rate is very low.�

An analysis from economists at Barclays suggest China�s fatality rate from an omicron wave would be 4 in 1,000 people, or 0.4%, among the unvaccinated. For the fully vaccinated, it could be two in 10,000, or 0.02%, they estimated.

The country�s top health authorities this week laid out how they will cope with rising infections. These include a triage plan to ensure residents who fall ill go to the most suitable medical institutions for their needs, rather than only renowned facilities that will be quickly overrun. Officials also are setting up isolated COVID-19 wards for pregnant women, patients battling other diseases and high-risk people with health conditions.

There are signs community medical centers across the country are being mobilized. The National Health Commission called on these grassroot institutions to act as ""gatekeepers,� providing a first point of care for patients with mild disease who need to self-medicate and recover at home. They also will be tasked with referrals to better equipped facilities for those with worsening symptoms.

Officials also vowed to add more hospital beds, especially in intensive care units, an area where China lags many developed countries by a large margin.

Yet China faces criticism that such plans have been left too late, with resources instead focused on keeping COVID-19 out � similar to Hong Kong, which found its health care system overrun earlier in the year.

Preparing hospitals and ensuring adequate care for the elderly is easier said than done, said Huang Yanzhong, a senior fellow for global health at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations.

""Training of ICU staff takes years and three years have been wasted,� he said. ""Local governments didn�t have the incentive or capability to do advanced planning, or stock up on drugs, while they were busy enforcing COVID zero. All the necessary planning has been put on the back burner.�

The depletion of fiscal coffers and rampant public discontent are driving the easing, he said, not the country�s readiness for a wave of infections.

Some health experts and economists say the government won�t try and rush its exit from zero-COVID, which means moving past the virus could take time.

Expectations that China could finish the job in two to three months are unrealistic, wrote Chang Shu, chief Asia economist for Bloomberg Economics. The rapid start could give way to a more measured approach, and the government could even backpedal to ""flatten the curve� and reduce the loss of life, she said.

""The moment the death rate goes up so fast, there will be measures to contain it,� Mokdad said. ""They aren�t going to let it rip, no.�

Eric Feigl-Ding, a Harvard-trained epidemiologist, said remaining restrictions will help slow the spread of infections, while people are also more likely to wear masks and stay home.

It still won�t be enough to contain the highly transmissible variant, said Feigl-Ding, chief of the COVID-19 Task Force at the World Health Network, who predicted half a dozen to a dozen cities will experience runaway transmission.

He is pinning his hopes on Chinese cities imposing circuit-breakers if hospitals are overwhelmed and use of the new CanSino Biologics inhaled vaccine that�s being rolled out.

While living with the virus will ultimately benefit the economy, the initial impact is expected to be negative.

""Both supply and demand will bear the brunt of a case surge,� said Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Group. ""Industrial workers might see widespread infections, while many residents would be reluctant to leave their homes. That will also weigh on consumption.�

Rising infections will curb economic growth at the end of 2022 and beginning of 2023, slowing from already subdued levels and likely falling below 3%, Hu said.

""The disruptions in the initial phase are probably inevitable,� Hu said. ""The weeks leading to the Chinese New Year will likely be chaotic. In this period, local government policies (are) also likely to vary as the singular goal of getting cases back to zero is gone and they are faced with a slew of new tasks.�

The fact that China is releasing the mitigation measures from zero-COVID without having fully established the methods to protect them as the pathogen spreads � namely vaccines, health care facilities and easy-to-access therapeutics � may make some backpedaling essential.

""The road to the full reopening could still be gradual, painful and bumpy,� said Ting Lu, chief economist for Nomura International. ""China does not appear to be well prepared for a massive wave of COVID infections, and it may have to pay for its procrastination on embracing a �living with COVID� approach.�",The Japan Times,9/12/2022 21:21:17,CENTER,44

Private sector economists have cut forecasts of annual growth to as low as below 3%, which would be less than half of last year�s 8.1% and among the weakest in decades.

Social media posts suggested some cities might have outbreaks that weren�t reflected in official figures.

Posts dated Thursday by 18 people who said they were in Baoding, a city of 11 million southwest of Beijing, reported they tested positive using home kits or had fevers, sore throats and headaches. Meanwhile, the Baoding city government reported no new cases since Tuesday.

Drugstores were mobbed by customers who bought medications to treat sore throats and headaches after rules were dropped that required pharmacists to report those purchases, prompting fears a customer might be forced into a quarantine center.

Also Friday, the market regulator announced prices of some medicines including Lianhua Qingwen, a traditional flu treatment, rose as much as 500% over the past month. It said sellers might be punished for price gouging.

Lines formed outside hospitals, though it wasn�t clear how many people wanted treatment for COVID-19 symptoms.

People waited four to five hours to get into the fever clinic of Chaoyang Hospital in Beijing, according to a woman who answered the phone there and would give only her surname, Sun. She said no virus test was required but patients had to show a smartphone �health code� app that tracks their vaccine status and whether they have been to areas deemed at high risk of infection.

Hong Kong, which enforces its own anti-virus strategy, has faced a similar rise in cases as the southern Chinese city tries to revive its struggling economy by loosening controls on travel and the opening hours of restaurants and pubs.

Hong Kong reported 75,000 new cases over the past week, up about 25% from the previous week. But those don�t include an unknown number of people who stay at home with COVID-19 symptoms and never report to the government.

What to expect next as China relaxes Covid controls,"BEIJING � As mainland China relaxes many of its stringent Covid controls, analysts point out the country is far from a quick return to a pre-pandemic situation.

National authorities announced sweeping changes on Wednesday to make it easier to travel domestically, keep businesses operating and allow Covid patients to quarantine at home.

�These measures are much welcome for an economy that has been severely battered this year,� Nomura�s chief China economist Ting Lu and a team said in a report.

�However, we would also caution that the road to full reopening may still be gradual, painful and bumpy,� they said. The country does not appear well prepared for a massive wave of infections, and the infection rate of 0.13% leaves the country far below that needed for herd immunity, according to the report.

Mainland China�s daily Covid infections, mostly asymptomatic, surged to a record high above 40,000 in late November. The number has since tapered off as cities reduced virus testing requirements.

The path forward for China to reopen may take a few months, with a surge in infections likely, according to a Goldman Sachs report on Dec. 4.

�With most of the population uninfected before reopening, lower elderly vaccination rates than many other economies, and cultural similarities, we think Hong Kong and Taiwan�s reopenings are most relevant for Mainland China,� said chief China economist Hui Shan and a team.

�Their experiences suggest that cases are likely to skyrocket upon reopening and linger for a while, a high elderly vaccination rate is key to a safe reopening, and mobility declines sharply as cases rise,� the Goldman report said.

In the last two months, Taiwan no longer required international travelers to quarantine upon arrival, and said people did not have to wear masks outdoors.

60% of people may get Covid
Last week, mainland Chinese authorities announced another push to vaccinate the country�s elderly.

In the near term, about 60% of people may get infected, regardless of how policy is adjusted, Feng Zijian, former deputy director of China�s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said Tuesday during a Tsinghua University talk. He said that figure could ultimately climb to 80% or 90%.

New measures released by the health commission Thursday focused on how to treat Covid patients at home, and included a list of medicines.

Whether out of necessity or precaution, local demand for related medication was already on the rise.

JD Health said online sales have climbed for cold medicines, fever-reducing drugs and related products. The company said its latest data showed transaction volume for the week ended Monday surged by 18 times versus October.

Looking ahead, it�s pretty clear that China�s Covid policy is about to cross a turning point, said Bruce Pang, chief economist and head of research for Greater China at JLL.

As of Wednesday, negative virus tests are no longer needed to travel within China, while large numbers of people typically travel around the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday, he said. That means there may be a surge in Covid infections, and China�s policy will never go back, Pang said.

Chinese travel booking site Trip.com said after the relaxation in domestic travel policies, flight ticket searches for the Lunar New Year, which falls in late January 2023, surged to the highest in three years.

Not a full reopening, yet
Health authorities emphasized Wednesday the latest changes do not imply a full reopening. There was no reduction in quarantine time for international travelers, and the measures include instances in which a negative virus test is still required.

At a local level, Beijing city said Wednesday evening that people wanting to dine in at restaurants would still need to show a negative virus test from within the last two days.

But it�s taking longer to process virus test results due to an increase in positive cases, local Beijing media reported Wednesday, citing a virus testing firm worker. Since virus tests are done in batches of 10, if one person�s result turns out positive, the machine needs to process additional tests, the report said.

Goldman Sachs analysts expect China�s reopening � defined as a shift away from lockdowns � to come in the second quarter of 2023, according to a separate report on Wednesday.

�An earlier-than-expected reopening would add more downward pressure to near-term growth but moderate upside risk to our 2023 full-year GDP growth forecast,� the analysts said.

They expect any initial reopening to create a drag on the economy �due to surging infections, a temporary shortage of labor supply and increased supply chain disruptions.�

China struggles with COVID infections after controls ease,"Xi�s government began to loosen controls Nov. 11 after promising to reduce their cost and disruption. Imports tumbled 10.9% from a year ago in November in a sign of weak demand. Auto sales fell 26.5% in October.

�Relaxing COVID controls will lead to greater outbreaks,� Neil Thomas and Laura Gloudeman of Eurasia Group said in a report. �But Beijing is unlikely to return to the extended blanket lockdowns that crashed the economy earlier this year.�

The changes suggest the ruling party is easing off its goal of preventing virus transmission, the basis of �zero COVID,� but officials say that strategy still is in effect.

Restrictions probably must stay in place at least through mid-2023, public health experts and economists say. They say millions of elderly people need to be vaccinated, which will take months, and hospitals need to be strengthened to cope with a surge in cases. Officials announced a vaccination campaign last week.

On Friday, the government reported 16,797 new cases, including 13,160 without symptoms. That was down about one-fifth from the previous day and less than half of last week�s daily peak above 40,000.

More changes announced Wednesday allow people with mild COVID-19 cases to isolate at home instead of going to a quarantine center that some complained were crowded and unsanitary. That addressed a major irritant for the public.

A requirement for subway riders, supermarket shoppers and others to show negative virus tests also was dropped, though they still are needed for schools and hospitals.

A post signed Where Dreams Begin Under Starlight by a user in Dazhou, a southwestern city in Sichuan province, said all but five students in a public school class of 46 were infected.

�It�s really amazing that the school insists students go to school,� the user wrote. The user, contacted through the account, declined to give a name or other details.

The requirement for hundreds of millions of people to be tested as often as once a day in some areas over the past two years helped the government spot infections with no symptoms. Ending that approach reduces the cost of monitoring employees and customers at offices, shops and other businesses. But it increases the risk they might spread the virus.

This week�s changes follow protests that erupted Nov. 25 in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities against the human cost of �zero COVID.�

It isn�t clear whether any of the changes were a response to the protests, which died out following a security crackdown.

The ruling party�s Politburo on Wednesday declared stabilizing weak economic growth its priority, though leaders have said local officials still are expected to protect the public.

�The re-pivot to growth and the exit from zero COVID are clear from the top level,� said Larry Hu and Yuxiao Zhang of Macquarie Group, an Australian bank, in a report. However, they warned, �uncertainties remain high,� including �how disruptive the exit of zero COVID could be.�

China struggles with COVID infections after controls ease,"BEIJING (AP) � A rash of COVID-19 cases in schools and businesses were reported Friday in areas across China after the ruling Communist Party loosened anti-virus rules as it tries to reverse a deepening economic slump.

While official data showed a fall in new cases, they no longer cover large parts of the population after the government on Wednesday ended mandatory testing for many people. That was part of dramatic changes aimed at gradually emerging from �zero COVID� restrictions that have confined millions of people to their homes and sparked protests and demands for President Xi Jinping to resign.

�There�s very few people coming in because there�s so many cases,� said Gang Xueping, a waitress in a Beijing restaurant. �The country�s just opened up. The first one or two months is definitely going to be serious. Nobody�s used to this yet.�

In other cities, social media users said coworkers or classmates were ill and some businesses had closed due to a lack of staff. It wasn�t clear from those accounts, many of which couldn�t be independently confirmed, how far above the official figure the total case numbers might be.

�I�m really speechless. Half of the company�s people are out sick, but they still won�t let us all stay home,� said a post signed Tunnel Mouth on the popular Sina Weibo platform. The user gave no name and didn�t respond to questions sent through the account, which said the user was in Beijing.

The reports echo the experience of the United States, Europe and other countries that have struggled with outbreaks while trying to restore business activity. But they are a jarring change for China, where �zero COVID,� which aims to isolate every case, disrupted daily life and depressed economic activity but kept infection rates low.

Xi�s government began to loosen controls Nov. 11 after promising to reduce their cost and disruption. Imports tumbled 10.9% from a year ago in November in a sign of weak demand. Auto sales fell 26.5% in October.
