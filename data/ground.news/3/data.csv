Putin threatens Russia could cut oil output over West�s price cap,"President Vladimir Putin says Russia will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the West�s �stupid� price cap on its oil.
Moscow � Russia, the world�s biggest exporter of energy, could cut oil production and will refuse to sell oil to any country that imposes the West�s �stupid� price cap on Russian oil, President Vladimir Putin said on Friday.

The Group of Seven major powers, the EU and Australia last week agreed a $60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil after EU members overcame resistance from Poland.

�As for our reaction, I have already said that we simply will not sell to those countries that make such decisions,� Putin told reporters in a news conference in the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek.

�We will think, maybe, even about a possible, if necessary ... reduction in production.�

Putin, who rules the world�s second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and the largest gas exporter, said Russia had a production agreement with other members of the Opec+ oil producers� club, so such a drastic step was still only a possibility.

�We are thinking about this, there are no solutions yet. And concrete steps will be outlined in a decree from the president of Russia that will be released in the next few days,� Putin said.

Selling oil and gas to Europe has been one of the main sources of Russia�s foreign currency earnings since Soviet geologists found oil and gas in the swamps of Siberia in the decades after World War 2.

Putin dismissed the West�s attempt to squeeze Russian finances, saying the $60 price cap corresponded to the price at which Russia was selling oil.

�It all boils down to about this figure,� Putin said. �So don�t worry about the budget.�

The price for Urals blend crude on Friday was around $53 per barrel, according to Reuters data.

The Kremlin chief cautioned that attempts by the West to impose a price cap would lead to the global collapse of the oil industry and then a catastrophic rise in prices.

�This will lead to the collapse of the industry itself, because the consumer will always insist that the price be lower. The industry is already underinvested, underfunded, and if we listen only to consumers, then this investment will be reduced to zero,� Putin said.

�All this will lead at some stage to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of the global energy sector. This is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and poorly thought-out.�

Putin threatens oil production cuts over price cap,"Russian president says future prisoner swaps with US are possible and Russia�s hypersonic weapons would defend it if attacked.
Russia will not sell oil to any country that imposes a price cap on its oil exports and is considering reducing its oil production, President Vladimir Putin says.

On Monday, the Group of Seven, European Union and Australia imposed a price limit on Russian oil of $60 per barrel in a move aimed at reducing Moscow�s ability to finance its war in Ukraine.
�I have already said that we simply will not sell to those countries that make such decisions,� Putin said on Friday at a news conference held after a regional summit in Kyrgyzstan�s capital, Bishkek.

�We will consider a possible reduction in production if necessary,� he added, calling the price cap a �stupid decision� that is �harmful to global energy markets�.

Putin also touched on several other subjects during the news conference. Here�s a roundup of what he said:

�Who is Yashin?� asked the Russian leader, responding to a question from a reporter. Just a few hours earlier, opposition leader Ilya Yashin, 39, was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison for spreading �fake information�. Yashin was indicted after discussing evidence of Russian atrocities perpetrated in the Ukrainian city of Bucha, north of Kyiv, casting doubts on the Kremlin�s narrative that said such reports had been fabricated as a �provocation� against Russia. Putin said it was wrong to doubt a court�s decision.
Putin said further prisoner swaps between the United States and Russia were possible and contacts between the two countries� intelligence services would continue. He made the comment a day after US basketball star Brittney Griner was swapped for arms dealer Viktor Bout. �Contacts continue. In fact, they have never stopped,� Putin said. �� We do not reject continuing this work in the future.� Russia continues to hold Paul Whelan, a former US marine who was convicted of espionage in 2020 in a trial that US diplomats said had been unfair and opaque.
Putin said Russia has no mandate to launch a preventive first nuclear strike, unlike the US, but Russia�s advanced hypersonic weapons would ensure Russia could respond forcefully if it ever came under attack.
The Russian leader acknowledged problems with procuring equipment and clothes for the hundreds of thousands of troops Moscow has conscripted to fight in Ukraine in recent months. He said some of the issues related to supplying the 300,000 men who were called up in a mobilisation drive in September and October were now easing.
Putin said he was �disappointed� by comments made by former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who told a German magazine that peace agreements aimed at ending the conflict in eastern Ukraine that began in 2014 had been an attempt to �give Ukraine time� to build up its defences. Russia-backed separatists seized parts of eastern Ukraine following Russia�s 2014 annexation of the Crimean Peninsula. The peace deals were never fully implemented.
Putin said Russia would likely have to reach a peace agreement regarding Ukraine in the future, but felt betrayed by the breakdown of the earlier Minsk agreements. Putin said mediators Germany and France had betrayed Russia and were now pumping Kyiv with weapons.",Al Jazeera,9/12/2022 22:16:39,CENTER,52
"Russia may cut oil output in response to G-7 price cap, Putin says","Russia may cut its oil production in response to the G-7 cap on the price of its crude, President Vladimir Putin said.
Russia may cut its oil production in response to the G-7 cap on the price of its crude, President Vladimir Putin said.

A decision on Moscow�s response will be announced in a presidential decree within the next several days, Putin told reporters in comments broadcast on state Rossiya 24 TV, providing no further details.

�I�m not saying now that this is a decision, but if necessary we�ll think about possible production cuts,� Putin said. �I have already said that we simply won�t sell oil to those countries� that participate in a price cap.

After months of planning and negotiations, the biggest tranche of international sanctions on Russian oil took effect on Monday. The European Union banned almost all seaborne imports of the country�s crude oil, and the G-7 agreed that anyone wanting to access key services that the bloc provides � especially insurance � will have to pay less than $60 a barrel.

There are still enormous unanswered questions that will shape the impact of the measures on the oil market, including the depth of non-European insurance markets, the appetite of some tanker owners to participate in trade with Russia, and exactly how effective enforcement of the cap can be.

�Whatever Russia does there are no good options,� Ben Harris, assistant secretary for economic policy at the US Treasury, said earlier this week. �Any supply disruption not only hurts their partners, but also really hurts their pocketbooks.�

Production, Revenue
Russia has said the effects of the price cap on oil production will be limited. Any volatility in the nation�s output �won�t be higher than the fluctuations in spring,� First Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin said earlier this week.

In April, two months into the invasion of Ukraine, Russia pumped an average of around 10.05 million barrels a day, down from 11.08 million a day in February, according to industry data seen by Bloomberg. Output then started to recover, reaching an eight-month high in November.
The price cap won�t have any negative consequences on Russia�s revenue as the $60 a barrel threshold introduced by western countries �corresponds to the prices at which we sell today,� Putin said. �We already sell at about these prices, so don�t worry about the budget.�

Russia�s flagship Urals crude that�s exported from the Baltic port of Primorsk was assessed at $41.59 a barrel on Thursday, according to data from Argus Media, whose figures the Russian government has used to calculate export duties.

However, the price of Russia�s ESPO crude blend in Asia is holding well above the western cap, trading at $67.11 a barrel on Thursday, Argus data show.",Energy Voice,9/12/2022 08:46:10,CENTER,53
Putin Eyes Slashing Oil Production Following G7 Price Cap,"On Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said his nation is eyeing a cut to crude oil production in response to the Group of Seven Nation�s (G7) price cap on Russian crude, Bloomberg reported Friday.

The G7, which includes the U.S. and Australia, imposed a $60 per barrel price cap on seaborne Russian oil on Dec. 5 to target Moscow�s oil revenues which are helping fund its invasion of Ukraine.

Putin told reporters on Russian state TV that Russia will consider cutting production due to the price cap and added that he would soon announce a presidential decree to further respond to G7�s move, according to Bloomberg.

�I�m not saying now that this is a decision, but if necessary we�ll think about possible production cuts,� Putin said.

Putin stated that Russia would not be financially affected by the $60 cap as the country already sells oil at around such a price and also reiterated that he would not sell oil to countries that impose a price cap, according to Bloomberg.

The average price of Urals crude, the Russian oil benchmark, is currently $53.23 per barrel, according to OilPrice. Russia is already selling substantial amounts of oil at a discounted price to countries like China which are not participating in the price cap framework, according to Reuters.

President Joe Biden banned Russian oil, natural gas, and coal imports in March in response to Russia�s invasion of Ukraine.

Putin threatens production cuts over oil price cap,"President Vladimir Putin warned Friday that Russia could reduce oil production in response to a $60 price cap on its oil exports agreed by Western nations over Moscow's Ukraine offensive.

The price ceiling agreed by the EU, G7 and Australia came into force on Monday and seeks to restrict Russia's revenue while making sure Moscow keeps supplying the global market.
""We will consider a possible reduction in production if necessary,"" Putin told reporters in Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek following a regional summit.
He said the price cap was a ""stupid decision"" that is ""harmful to global energy markets"" but ""isn't affecting"" Russia.
He added that Moscow will announce retaliatory steps ""in the next few days"". He did not elaborate.
The market price of a barrel of Russian Urals crude is currently around $65 dollars, just slightly higher than the $60 cap agreed, suggesting the measure may have only a limited impact in the short term.",Deccan Herald,9/12/2022 18:22:08,LEFT,55
"Putin calls oil price cap 'stupid,' and says Russia is considering slashing oil production in response","Russia will consider slashing its oil output in retaliation to the G7 and European Union's price cap, according to President Vladimir Putin.

""We will think, maybe even about the possible, if necessary � reduction in production,"" he said at a press event on Friday. 

Putin added that Russia's finances wouldn't be hit by the new measures and the West's implementation of a price cap was ""stupid,"" Reuters reported. He also warned energy prices would ""skyrocket"" for any countries that participated in the price cap.

The defiant remarks come after Russia's central bank warned that the price cap and latest round of sanctions were ""economic shocks"" to the nation. 

On Monday, the EU's embargo on seaborne Russian oil imports took effect, along with a $60-a-barrel price cap on Moscow's crude that is meant to prevent a supply shock and limit Putin's energy revenue.  

Companies that abide by the price cap will be able to use European shipping and insurance services to send oil to Asia, where some countries have been snapping up Russian oil at hefty discounts since the invasion of Ukraine.

But Russia reducing its oil production could rock energy markets, experts have warned, worsening the supply shortage and hiking crude prices even higher. That scenario could cause oil prices to surge as high as $380 a barrel, JPMorgan previously predicted, though Russia is also reportedly considering a price floor.

Meanwhile, there have already been shipping disruptions as a result of the EU sanctions. Oil tankers have piled up off the coast of Turkey as ships were asked for proof of insurance coverage.",Business Insider,9/12/2022 19:51:07,LEFT,56

The Group of Seven and Australia last week agreed a US$60 per barrel price cap on Russian seaborne crude oil after European Union members overcame resistance from Poland.

Putin also said Moscow would not lose out from the West's price cap and that the government's finances would hold up fine.

He said the West's move was ""stupid"" and that energy prices would ""skyrocket"" for those who imposed the caps.

Russia will not suffer losses because of oil price cap � Putin,"As the President noted, the price cap for Russian oil introduced by Western countries will eventually affect the entire world market
BISHKEK, December 9. /TASS/. The efforts to cap oil prices will not harm Russia, President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Friday.

""The proposed cap corresponds to the prices at which we sell [oil] today. In this sense, this decision does not affect us in any way. To be honest, it doesn�t matter to us. We also make discounts for many partners. We all converge approximately at this figure. Therefore, we will not have losses under any circumstances,"" Putin said.

As the President noted, the price cap for Russian oil introduced by Western countries will eventually affect the entire world market.

""This applies to all producers. Why? Because if someone ever agrees that the consumer will determine the price, then this will lead to the collapse of the industry itself. Because the consumer will always insist that the price should be lower. The industry is already underinvested, underfunded. If we listen only to consumers, then this investment will shrink to zero and at some stage this will lead to a catastrophic surge in prices and to the collapse of world energy,"" Putin said.

According to the Russian leader, ""this is a stupid proposal, ill-conceived and uncalculated."" He called the introduction of a price cap a harmful decision for world energy markets. At the same time, Putin dismissed the possibility that the price cap would cause problems for the Russian budget.

""We are selling [oil] at these prices anyway now. So, don�t worry about the budget. But I repeat once again. It would be stupid for everyone to follow some non-market, harmful decision. And for consumers as well because they should realize: if they insist on prices that are comfortable to them, even if they achieve this and prices go down, investments will be reduced to zero, and eventually prices will skyrocket and hit them.
