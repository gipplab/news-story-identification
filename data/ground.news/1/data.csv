Europe's ambitious green hydrogen pipeline to be ready by 2030,"The leaders of France, Spain and Portugal on Friday officially approved an ambitious underwater pipeline to bring green hydrogen from the Iberian Peninsula to the rest of Europe

The H2Med project, set to be completed by 2030 at a cost of about �2.5 billion ($2.6 billion), will help Europe make the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy.

It comes as Europe scrambles to reduce its dependence on Russian oil and gas following the invasion of Ukraine.

The pipeline between Barcelona and Marseille will carry two million tonnes of hydrogen per year, or 10 per cent of European consumption, once it goes online, said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.

�It is going to be the first major hydrogen corridor in the European Union,� Mr Sanchez said.

The project will cost around �2.5 billion, he said at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron and Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa.

The three leaders formally signed off on the plans in the presence of EU Commission chief Ursula Von der Leyen on the sidelines of a regional EU summit.

Following the talks, they released a road map and timeline for completing H2Med which they hope will be partially covered by European funds.

The pipeline under the Mediterranean Sea will carry green hydrogen, which is made from water via electrolysis in a process using renewable energy.

The road map detailed three options for the route of the pipeline, with the preferred one stretching 455km at a maximum depth of 2,600 metres.

Construction will begin in 2025 and last four years and eight months, it said.

H2Med aims to boost the decarbonisation of European industry, giving it large-scale access to clean energy from Spain and Portugal, which are hoping to become world leaders in green hydrogen thanks to their numerous wind and solar power farms.

�The focus of H2 demand is on sectors that are difficult to decarbonise, such as industry and transport,� the road map said.

�The cost of H2 transmission by pipeline over long distances is 2 to 4 times lower than transmitting electricity over high-voltage lines.�

Announced at an EU summit in October, the pipeline offers an alternative to the defunct 2003 MidCat pipeline project which was to have carried gas across the Pyrenees from Spain to France.

It was abandoned in 2019 over profitability issues and objections from Paris and environmentalists.

Initially, the idea was for the pipeline to carry gas from the Iberian Peninsula to central Europe, given Spain and Portugal's huge capacity for turning liquefied natural gas that arrives in tankers back into gas form.

But Mr Costa stressed that the pipeline would carry only green hydrogen.

The meeting took place just before a EuroMed 9 summit bringing together Croatia, Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the pipeline, dubbed H2Med, will be able to convey some 2 million metric tons of hydrogen to France annually � 10% of the EU´s estimated hydrogen needs. The project is expected to cost 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion).

Article content
The announcement came after a meeting between Sanchez, his French and Portuguese counterparts and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in the eastern Spanish city of Alicante.

�Today, the Iberian Peninsula is becoming a major European energy gateway to the world,� Von der Leyen said at a joint press briefing.

French President Emmanuel Macron said H2Med, which replaces an earlier proposal to transport gas across the Pyrenees Mountains, will �take a new path through the Mediterranean and rely on a technology of the future, which is hydrogen.�

�It will also probably allow later other European interconnections toward some other countries which will want to get that hydrogen,� he added.

Portugal, Spain and France struck a broad deal on the plan in October. They hope to present it to the European Commission by Dec. 15 so it will be eligible for EU financing, which could represent as much as 50% of the cost.

Article content
The project will first connect two plants in northern Portugal and northern Spain and then involve a pipeline under the Mediterranean Sea from the northeastern Spanish port of Barcelona to France�s Marseille.

�We are strengthening European Union�s strategic autonomy and energy security at a moment when solidarity among Europeans is essential to reduce energy dependency on countries that use energy as a blackmailing tool,� Sanchez said, in reference to Russia and the gas crisis that has emerged since the war in Ukraine.

He said that with the project, they �aspire to be a benchmark not only in Europe, but also worldwide, in the field of hydrogen.�

Spain and Portugal had initially wanted to pipe gas across land to France but Paris rejected that proposal.

�Hydrogen is a game-changer for Europe,� said Von der Leyen.

She said the EU planned to produce 10 million metric tons of renewable hydrogen by 2030 and to import another 10 million tons.

The pipeline under the Mediterranean Sea will carry green hydrogen, which is made from water via electrolysis in a process using renewable energy.

ALICANTE, Spain, Dec 9 (Reuters) - An underwater pipeline to carry green hydrogen between Spain and France will cost about 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion), Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Friday, adding he hoped the European Union would partly fund the project.

The pipeline between Barcelona and Marseille will have a capacity of 2 million tonnes a year and be ready by the end of the decade, Sanchez said at a summit of Mediterranean European Union leaders in the southeastern Spanish port city of Alicante.

The decision to pursue the project comes as an energy crisis caused by the war in Ukraine has accelerated European plans to bolster renewable energy as an alternative to Russian gas.

The corridor will make Iberia ""a major energy hub"" and form part of a ""European hydrogen backbone"" allowing the bloc to pump hydrogen across the continent as it seeks to produce 10 million tonnes of clean hydrogen a year and import a further 10 million tonnes by 2030, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.

""Hydrogen is a game changer for Europe,"" von der Leyen said. ""We want to make hydrogen a central part of our energy system in the transition to climate neutrality.""

Green hydrogen is made from electrolysers powered by renewable energy. Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said the Iberian peninsula's abundance of sunshine and wind used for renewable energy would make producing the hydrogen competitive.

French President Emmanuel Macron said the pipeline could also be used to send hydrogen produced in France from nuclear energy - so-called red hydrogen - in the opposite direction.

Reuters reported earlier that the undersea part of the 455-kilometre (280-mile) pipeline would cost around 2 billion euros, rising to 3 billion depending on its route.

An additional pipeline connecting Spain and Portugal will cost 350 million euros, according to a document provided by Spain.

The submarine section will be known as BarMar, while the entire hydrogen corridor connecting Spain and Portugal to France will be called H2MED, Sanchez confirmed.

Sanchez said France, Spain and Portugal would apply for EU funds to pay for up to 50% of H2MED's cost. The other half would be funded by the three countries' national grids, but the project also aims to attract private investment, Spanish government sources added.

The submarine pipeline was proposed in October as a substitute for the so-called MidCat gas pipeline project across the Pyrenees, which had been championed by Spain and Portugal who said it could relieve immediate pressure on gas supplies.

Paris opposed the plan, arguing that two existing pipelines across the Pyrenees which divide the Iberian Peninsula from France were already under-utilised.

The new underwater pipeline was originally proposed to carry some natural gas as well, but will now only carry hydrogen in order to meet EU funding criteria, Costa said.

Some observers are sceptical about H2MED's chances of success, with Faig Abbasov, shipping programme director at Transport & Environment, a Brussels-based NGO, labelling it ""window dressing"" to reduce political tensions raised by MidCat.

""If you already have an overland pipeline why build an undersea pipeline?"" Abbasov said. ""Spain would be better off exporting by sea.""
